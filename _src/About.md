# About Me

<img src="img/AlexH.jpg" class="rounded float-left gap-right" width="200"/>

My name is Alex Hars√°nyi; I live in Perth, Western Australia and I work as a
Software Engineer at [Immersive Technologies][immtec] where I help build
mining equipment simulators.  I know a few things about C++, electronics,
micro-controller firmware, computer networking and DirectX graphics.

As a hobby, I enjoy swimming, biking and running, and doing all these things
back to back as part of triathlons.  However, I'm just a middle-of-the pack
age-group athlete, so I need to keep my day job.  I also enjoy collecting data
during training, like Heart Rate, Speed, Cadence and analyzing it.  I even
wrote my own application to visualize this data,
[ActivityLog2](./2017/09/introducing-activitylog2.html), and wrote several
blog posts containing modest attempts to analyze training data and gain some
insights from it.

I have a few hobby projects which I keep on [GitHub][gh], and you can find
blog posts about them on this site.

# About Me

My name is Alex Hars√°nyi.  I live in Perth, Western Australia and I work as a
Software Engineer at [Immersive Technologies][immtec] where I help build
mining equipment simulators.  I know a few things about electronics,
micro-controller firmware, computer networking and DirectX graphics.  At work,
I mostly program in C++ and I actually like it.

As a hobby, I enjoy swimming, biking and running, and doing all these things
back to back as part of triathlons.  However, I'm just a middle-of-the pack
age-group athlete, so I need to keep my day job.  I also enjoy collecting data
during training, like Heart Rate, Speed, Cadence and analyzing it.  I even
wrote my own application to visualize this data,
[ActivityLog2](./2017/09/introducing-activitylog2.html), and wrote several
blog posts containing modest attempts to analyze training data and gain some
insights from it.

I keep my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/alex-hhh).

I paid $600 for my Garmin FR920 GPS watch, and since I got it, I bought six
pairs of running shoes totaling $1124 and went to the swimming pool 153 times:
at approximately $5 for a swim session, this is $765 spend on swimming.  While
the FR920 cost more than a single pair of running shoes or a single swimming
session, it actually comes out as cheaper to own than the previous two.

The [ActivityLog2](/2017/09/introducing-activitylog2.html) application can
track equipment used in each training session, such as running shoes, GPS
watch or bike.  I use this feature mostly to track service reminders: when to
replace running shoes or the chain on my bikes, but once in a while I export
the usage data as a CSV file, load it up in Google Sheets and calculate
*cost/use* values for the equipment I use.  The **cost/use** metric is simply
the cost of the equipment divided by the number of uses.  I think this is a
more relevant metric than simply the cost, since a piece of equipment that I
use a lot is more worth while than a cheaper one that I don't use much.

Using the cost/use metric, my **Garmin FR920** is the least expensive piece of
equipment I own: I purchased one in November 2014 for $600 and I used it 772
times on running, swimming, biking and hiking sessions.  The cost for each
session comes out to be just $0.78. I plan to use my FR920 for at least
another 6 months and, in that time, the cost/use will come down but at the
same time, I will get another pair of running shoes and spend a lot more on
swimming.  The table below summarizes the cost/use for the FR920 versus
running shoes or swimming sessions :

| Equipment        | Cost / Session |
|------------------|---------------:|
| Garmin FR920     |          $0.78 |
| Running Shoes    |          $2.66 |
| Swimming Session |          $5.00 |

I buy a new pair of **running shoes** after I use the old pair for about 750 -
800 km .  Some time ago, I noticed that my knees started hurting once I ran
more than 800 km on a pair of shoes, so now I try to replace them at 750 km.
Looking at 11 pair of shoes I went through in the past 7 years, I pay on
average $173 for a pair and use it about 65 times: the average cost for a
running session is about $2.66.

The **bikes** are probably the most expensive item even using the *cost/use*
metric: my mid-range road bike (the *Azuri Imperia*), which I had for 7 years,
still cost me $5.99.  My TT bike (a *Specialized Shiv*) still cost $63.49,
although I only had it for less than 2 years and used it only 63 times.  Also,
bikes are the only piece of equipment that I service regularly, so there is an
additional cost of owning them, this cost is not included in these
calculations.  **Power meters** are another piece of equipment with a high
*cost/use*, although less so than the bikes, probably because they cost less.

The full usage and costs are listed below.  *Azuri Imperia* and *Specialized
Shiv* are my bikes (road and TT respectively), the *Vector* and *Vector 2* are
power meters, one for each bike.  The *Brooks* set of "equipment" are all
running shoes. *Tacx Vortex* is a bike trainer.  The rest of the equipment
names should be self explanatory. The "Retired?" column shows equipment which
I no longer use, for these the cost / use and cost / hour will remain fixed.
For each equipment that is not retired, the cost / use and cost / hour will
come down as the use count and hours used increase while the cost stays the
same.

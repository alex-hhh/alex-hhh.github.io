"\n<p>I bought a 433Mhz receiver shield for Arduino as I wanted to experiment with wireless communication, and, as the first application, I built a receiver that can read serial numbers and button status from my garage door opener remote.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>The remote used by the garage door opener is built using the HCS200 chip, which is a code hopping encoder. It used in many remote key-less entry systems and seems to be quite popular: I personally have three key remotes that use this chip, all for different systems. The HCS200 works with digital signals only, i.e. it does not transmit anything, instead, its digital output pin is usually connected to a 433Mhz transmitter directly, to use what is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-off_keying\">On-Off Keying</a> modulation. Up to 4 buttons can be connected tp the chip, these are wired directly to a key on the remote. Pressing any of the buttons causes the chip to continuously transmit a code word and a 433Mhz receiver can read this code word, authenticate it, and &ldquo;act&rdquo; upon it, for example open or close a garage door.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBQeyzdu_kk\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Sometimes these chips are also connected to 315Mhz transmitters, I found this to be the case with older remotes. With such a remote, a 315Mhz receiver is needed. If you want to build a received for your own remote it is best to check what frequency it is using for its transmission.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The chip encrypts a part of its transmission. I do not have the keys for decoding this information, as such the code presented here cannot be used to authenticate the transmissions. It can only be used to identify key remotes based on their serial numbers as well as determining which buttons on the remotes were pressed.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"the-hardware\">The hardware</h2>\n\n<p>To receive the transmissions, I used a 433Mhz Arduino receiver shield. There are many of these on the market, mine is from <a href=\"https://www.freetronics.com.au/products/receiver#.Wvt3NaqFNhF\">Freetronics</a>. I had to solder the stackable headers myself in order to fit it on the Arduino UNO board.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/433Mhz-shield.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p><strong>Data Pin:</strong> The receiver shield has only one data pin: it reads high when the carrier wave is detected and low when the carrier wave is not detected. The pin is connected to <code>D8</code> on the Arduino, but I also connected it to <code>D2</code> so I can attach an interrupt and receive data that way (this is the orange jumper wire in the picture).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Antenna:</strong> There is also pin connection for the antenna, this is a piece of wire about 15 to 17 cm in length that is attached to a pin on the side (the green wire in the picture). Without an antenna wire, the receiver has very poor performance, so make sure you don&rsquo;t forget about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Status LEDs:</strong> The 433Mhz receiver shield was supposed to have two general purpose leds connected to D6 and D7, but these didn&rsquo;t work on the shield I got, perhaps they were faulty. I wired instead two external leds on the breadboard, a green one which lights up for the <strong>preamble</strong> and a red one which lights up when data is received.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-transmission-overview\">Data Transmission Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The 433Mhz transmission uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-off_keying\">On-Off Keying</a> modulation, which is a type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying\">Amplitude-Shift keying</a> modulation. The two terms are abbreviated as <strong>OOK</strong> and <strong>ASK</strong> respectively, but, in practical terms, what this means is that, to transmit a digital signal of ones and zeros, the 433Mhz carrier wave is ON, or transmitted, when the digital signal is 1 and it is OFF when the digital signal is 0. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/signal-transmission.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>Theoretically, data can be transmitted directly over the wire simply by controlling the on-off state of the transmitter using a shift register, but this would create problems since long strings of ones or zeros would be difficult to detect by the receiver. Instead, the HCS200 encodes each bit using 3 clock cycles, where a 0 places the digital signal high for 2 clock cycles and low or one clock cycle, while a 1 places the digital signal high for one clock cycle and low for two clock cycles. Here is how it looks:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/logic-0-1.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>With this encoding, there are no long periods of ON or OFF transmissions, and a receiver can decode the transmission without having to have an accurate clock. For example, to transmit the number 240, which is 11110000 in binary, the signal pattern would look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/transmit-240.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>In addition to the patterns for 1 and 0, the HCS200 also uses a preamble signal: this signal is a sequence of ON and OFF periods of equal length. Since the encodings for 0 and 1 have different lengths for their ON and OFF periods, the preamble cannot be confused with a regular data and can be used by a receiver to detect the beginning of a transmission.</p>\n\n<p>When it transmits, the HCS200 always sends 66 bits of data in a loop &mdash; the same 66 bits are send repeatedly while the button is pressed. Each individual transmission begins with a <strong>preamble</strong> signal. Following the preamble, there is a <strong>header</strong> time when the transmitter is silent and following the header, the 66 bits of data are sent &mdash; these are encoded as described above. The bits are split in two equal parts: 32 <strong>encrypted bits</strong> and 34 unencrypted bits or <strong>fixed bits</strong> , the contents of the bits are explained in the code word description below. After all the data is transmitted, there is another <strong>guard time</strong> where the transmitter is silent and this may be followed by another transmission:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/hcs200-transmission.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>Each HCS200 transmission forms a code word with the structure shown below. The encrypted part would need to be decrypted first and contains the sequence counter for the transmitter, which allows the receiver to determine if the received code word is valid or not. Decryption requires a decryption key, which is only known to the manufacturers, without this, the transmitter cannot be authenticated. The unencrypted part, however, contains the transmitter&rsquo;s serial number as well as the status of its buttons (each transmitter can have up to 4 buttons).</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/hcs200-code-word.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-software\">The Software</h2>\n\n<p>The source code for this project is available on GitHub, in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/Arduino_433Mhz\">Arduino_433Mhz</a>, the sketch is named <code>hcs200</code>. The code sets up an interrupt handling routine for input pin <code>D2</code>, which processes the data from the 433Mhz shield. The main loop just looks for a received code word and prints it out.</p>\n\n<p>The Arduino program begins running with the <code>setup</code> function. This function ensures that the pins are setup correctly, <code>D8</code> and <code>D2</code> as inputs from the 433Mhz shield and <code>D6</code> and <code>D7</code> as outputs to the lets on the breadboard. The setup code also sets up the <code>pin2ISR</code> as the function to be called when data on the input pin <code>D2</code> changes, this function will be called when the input pin changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"cp\">#define PREAMBLE_LED 7</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#define DATA_LED 6</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">setup</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">Serial</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">begin</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">38400</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// Board has the data bit wired to pin 8, and we bridge it to pin 2 to be</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// able to attach an interrupt.</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">pinMode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">INPUT</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">pinMode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">INPUT</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">pinMode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">PREAMBLE_LED</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">OUTPUT</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">pinMode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">DATA_LED</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">OUTPUT</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">attachInterrupt</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">digitalPinToInterrupt</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">pin2ISR</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">CHANGE</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">Serial</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Started listening</span><span class=\"se\">\\n</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>pin2ISR</code> maintains some global state about the state of the receive, since it is invoked each time the digital input changes. First, it maintains <code>rx_state</code>, which records the phase of the receive: <code>RS_NOSYNC</code> when no receive is in progress, <code>RS_PREAMBLE</code> when the preamble is being received, <code>RS_DATA</code> when the actual code word data is being received and <code>RS_COMPLETED</code> indicates that an entire code word has been received.</p>\n\n<p>Received data is stored in <code>rx_buf</code> which is an array of three 32 bit numbers, which can hold a total of 96 bits. The HCS200 sends out only 66 bits, so this buffer is large enough. The next position in the receive buffer is stored in <code>rx_bit_count</code>, but since data is received bit-by-bit, this records the number of bits.</p>\n\n<p>In order to determine what is a &ldquo;long pulse&rdquo; and what is a &ldquo;short pulse&rdquo;, the decoder needs to know the transmission clock period. This is stored in <code>tx_clock</code> and it is determined during the preamble phase which contains transitions every clock period.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <code>last_timestamp</code> and <code>last_pulse_width</code> are used to keep track of the previous timestamp and pulse width and it is used to decode the bits in the transmission.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"n\">RxState</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">RS_NOSYNC</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>                      <span class=\"c1\">// Receiver is inactive</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">RS_PREAMBLE</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>                    <span class=\"c1\">// 50% duty cycle</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">RS_DATA</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>                        <span class=\"c1\">// DATA is being received</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">RS_COMPLETED</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span>                    <span class=\"c1\">// Receive complete</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">volatile</span> <span class=\"kt\">char</span> <span class=\"n\">rx_state</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">RS_NOSYNC</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">char</span> <span class=\"n\">rx_bit_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">uint32_t</span> <span class=\"n\">rx_buf</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">unsigned</span> <span class=\"n\">tx_clock</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">unsigned</span> <span class=\"kt\">long</span> <span class=\"n\">last_timestamp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">unsigned</span> <span class=\"n\">last_pulse_width</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>pin2ISR</code> function is shown below. It first determines the &ldquo;pulse width&rdquo; which is the time since the function was last called, and reads the state of the input pin. It may be useful to review the transmission pattern of the HCS200 to better understand what is happening:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a013/hcs200-transmission.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>Depending on the state of the receiver (the <code>rx_state</code> value), the <code>pin2ISR</code> function will do one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>if the receiver is inactive, <code>RS_NOSYNC</code>, it looks for a long pulse width,  this corresponds to a long silence before a transmission. If it finds one,  it puts the receiver in <code>RS_PREAMBLE</code> state.</li>\n <li>In <code>RS_PREAMBLE</code> state, the receiver tries to determine the clock period ,  <code>tx_clock</code>, by averaging the pulse widths. If it determines that the last  pulse width was a long one, it switches the to start receiving the data  bits.</li>\n <li>In <code>RS_DATA</code> state, the receiver tries to decode the received bits. It does  that by looking at the last two pulses: a long pulse followed by a short one  represents a <code>1</code> and a short pulse followed by a long one represents a <code>0</code>  (see how the logic 1 and 0 are encoded by the HCS200). In each case it  stores the bit in the appropriate place in <code>rx_buf</code>. Once all bits are  received, the state is changed to <code>RS_COMPLETED</code>, and the main program loop  can now inspect the received code word. The <code>Classify</code> function is used to  determine if a pulse is short, <code>RB_SHORT</code> or long, <code>RB_LONG</code> this function  is not shown here, it is available in the GitHub repository.</li>\n <li>Note that the function does nothing while the receiver is in <code>RS_COMPLETED</code>  state &mdash; in this state, it waits for the main program loop to read the  received data and to reset the state back to <code>RS_NOSYNC</code>, so a new code word  can be received.</li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td

It might be a good idea to at least briefly read the previous blog post, as this one does not go into the details explained there.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-enclosure\">New enclosure</h2>\n\n<p>I was not happy with the original enclosure that I used for this project, as it was too big for the actual board. I also, unwisely, soldered the buzzer onto the PCB assembly and the buzzer was too tall, so I had to cut out a bit of the box to make room for the buzzer. The end result was not very nice, so I decided to look for another enclosure.</p>\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time looking for plastic enclosures in electronics shops, but all the ones I found were either too big or too small. In the end, I found some mints in a tin box in a lolly shop, and the tin box was the exact size needed for my project. So the tin box only cost about $5.50 and I also got some mints.</p>\n\n<p>The new box fit perfectly the two new buttons (reset and calibrate) plus the PCB assembly and the buzzer, which I removed from the board and attached it to some wires, so the placement was more flexible.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"myCarousel\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\"><!-- Indicators--> \n <ol class=\"carousel-indicators\">\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"0\" class=\"active\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"1\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"2\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"3\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"4\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"5\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"6\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"7\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"8\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"9\"></li>\n  <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"10\"></li></ol> <!-- Wrapper for slides--> \n <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n  <div class=\"item active\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-1.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-2.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-3.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-4.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-5.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-6.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-7.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-8.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-9.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-10.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div> \n  <div class=\"item\"><img src=\"/img/a011/assembly-11.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerometer Assembly\" /></div></div> <!-- Left and right controls--> <a class=\"left carousel-control\" href=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide=\"prev\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span> <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span></a> <a class=\"right carousel-control\" href=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide=\"next\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span> <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span></a></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-room-in-the-data-memory\">Making room in the data memory</h2>\n\n<p>The first version of the program used most of the available data memory on the Arduino Nano board, with only 311 bytes remaining for function calls and local variables:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Sketch uses 19538 bytes (63%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.</p>\n <p>Global variables use 1737 bytes (84%) of dynamic memory, leaving 311 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.</p>\n <p>Low memory available, stability problems may occur.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Before I could make any enhancements, which would use even more data memory, I had to free up some of this data memory. One thing I found out about the ATmega328P chip, which is what the Arduino Nano uses, is that string constants are stored in data space. For example, a simple <code>Serial.println(\"Hello\")</code>, uses 6 bytes of data space (the string &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and the terminating 0). Six bytes might not seem much on a normal computer, but the ATmega328P chip only has 2048 bytes of data memory.</p>\n\n<p>The ATmega328P has a memory space to hold programs and a memory space to hold data. With my sketch, I had 11&prime;182 bytes of program space left and I looked for a way for it to store some data. The program space cannot be changed at runtime, so it can only hold constant data, but the strings are constants, so they could be stored there.</p>\n\n<p>The Arduino programing environment has the <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/utilities/progmem/\">PROGMEM</a> construct, which instructs the compiler to store the data in program memory. Unfortunately, this makes accessing the data more complicated, as the data stored in program memory cannot be accessed directly.</p>\n\n<p>To put the constant strings into program memory, each string has to be declared using <code>PROGMEM</code> and all the strings have to be put in a separate table, <code>string_table</code>, which is also declared using <code>PROGMEM</code>. To print out a string, first it has to be copied back into a local buffer (which is in data memory), using <code>strcpy_P</code>, than it can be used. I wrote the <code>oled_print_from_progmem</code> function which wraps all this process and can be used to display constant strings, it uses an index instead of the string directly, but I also defined convenient constants for these strings.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: C\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">const</span> <span class=\"kt\">char</span> <span class=\"n\">string_0</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span> <span class=\"n\">PROGMEM</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Roll\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">const</span> <span class=\"kt\">char</span> <span class=\"n\">string_1</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span> <span class=\"n\">PROGMEM</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Pitch\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"c1\">// ... other strings ommited</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">const</span> <span class=\"kt\">char</span><span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">const</span> <span class=\"n\">string_table</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span> <span class=\"n\">PROGMEM</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">string_0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">string_1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"c1\">// ... other strings ommited</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Name the string indices, for easy of use</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#define ROLL_STR 0</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#define PITCH_STR 1</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">oled_print_from_progmem</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">int</span> <span class=\"n\">text_size</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">int</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">int</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">int</span> <span class=\"n\">string_index</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">char</span> <span class=\"n\">buffer</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">oled</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">setTextSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text_size</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">oled</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">setCursor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">strcpy_P</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">buffer</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">char</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">pgm_read_word</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">string_table</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">string_index</span><span class=\"p\">])));</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">oled</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">buffer</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The strings where using the most of the memory, however, I also put the CRC constant table in PROGMEM, this is used by the CRC function that validates the calibration stored in EEPROM (this is described below).</p>\n\n<p>The end result is that, after adding functionality, and more data to the program, I still ended up 347 data memory available, compared with 311 bytes when I started:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Sketch uses 21474 bytes (69%) of program storage space.

A &ldquo;hold max&rdquo; function will prevent the maximum angles to be updated, if that is the case, the max angles will blink.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a011/display.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"obtaining-forward-backward-and-left-right-information-for-pitch-and-roll-angles\">Obtaining forward-backward and left-right information for pitch and roll angles</h3>\n\n<p>The previous code could calculate the roll and pitch angles, but it would not display the direction. That is, it might display a 2 degree roll but it would not show if it was left or right. For large angles, the direction is obvious for anyone who sits in the car, but for small angles, it is not. I extended the <code>calculate_pitch</code> function to return a negative angle if the vehicle is pitched up and a positive angle if it is pitched down. Similarly, the <code>calculate_roll</code> function was extended to return a negative angle for a left roll and a positive angle for a right roll. The display code was than updated to look at the sign of these angles and display the &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;down&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; strings, as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>When using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product\">dot product</a> to calculate angles, the angles always come out as positive, but we can look at the individual components of the acceleration vector to determine the orientation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>the X axis is the forward-backward axis, so if the X component of the vector  is positive, the &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction is pointing up, so the vehicle is pitched  upwards</li>\n <li>the Y axis is the left-right axis, so if the Y component of the vector is  positive, the &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction is pointing to the right, so the vehicle is  rolling to the right.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The updated code is shown below, <a href=\"/2017/12/arduino-inclinometer.html#calculating-pitch-and-roll\">this</a> section shows how the angles are actually calculated.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: C\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n

The reset button is wired to pin 11 on the Arduino, using a pull up resistor. As a side note, I only found out about the internal Arduino pull up resistors after I soldered my own external resistors to the board, if I knew about them earlier it would have saved me the trouble of soldering my own resistors. The reset button is active low, meaning that a <code>digitalRead</code> for the pin will read 0 if the button is pressed and 1 if the button is released.</p>\n\n<p>Handling the reset button is done in the <code>handle_reset_button</code> function, which is called repeatedly as part of the <code>loop</code> function of the Arduino program.</p>\n\n<p>To check if the button has been held down for about one second, the <code>reset_hold_time</code> global variable is incremented by <code>delta_time</code> each time the button is found to be pressed. Each time the button is released, <code>reset_hold_time</code> is set back to 0, so that the reset time is only counted for a single long press of the reset button. When <code>reset_hold_time</code> exceeds <code>HOLD_INTERVAL</code>, the maximum pitch and roll angles are set back to 0. <code>delta_time</code> represents the amount of time passed since the last <code>loop</code> invocation, it is set in the <code>update_timer</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>When the button is released, that is, <code>digitalRead</code> reads a 1, the <code>HOLD_MAX_FLAG</code> is toggled, to enable or disable the update of the maximum roll and pitch angles. Before the flag is toggled, the code checks to see if the button was held down for a short period, by checking the value in <code>reset_hold_time</code>, this prevents accidental presses and helps with debouncing the signal from the button.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: C\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"cp\">#define HOLD_INTERVAL (1000000) </span><span class=\"c1\">// microseconds</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#define RESET_PIN 11</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">int32_t</span> <span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_reset_button</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">digitalRead</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">RESET_PIN</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">HOLD_INTERVAL</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">HOLD_INTERVAL</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">TOGGLE_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">HOLD_MAX_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"n\">delta_time</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">reset_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">HOLD_INTERVAL</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">max_pitch</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">max_roll</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">CLR_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">HOLD_MAX_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-demand-calibration\">On demand calibration</h3>\n\n<p>The inclinometer unit can be installed in any position inside a vehicle and can determine its own orientation. This simplifies the installation process, as the alternative would have been to install the accelerometer unit aligned with the forward direction of the car. In the first version of the software, the unit would determine its own orientation every time it is powered up, however this requires the vehicle to be on flat ground when the unit is powered up and this is not always possible.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid this situation, the new software will save the orientation matrix to EEPROM and restore it at power up. The unit will only enter calibration when the calibrate button is held down. The calibrate button is wired to pin 12 on the Arduino Nano board with a pull up resistor, just like the reset button. A similar technique is used to make sure the button is held down for one second before the unit enters calibration mode. The <code>handle_calibrate_button</code> works like the <code>handle_reset_button</code> function, but, since the calibrate button has no function when it is held down briefly, the resulting code is simpler.</p>\n\n<p>To enter calibration mode, the function will set the state of the program to <code>STATE_ACQUIRE_DOWN_DIRECTION</code>, which is the first calibration step, and will also reset the internal state of the program.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: C\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"cp\">#define HOLD_INTERVAL (1000000) </span><span class=\"c1\">// microseconds</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#define CALIBRATE_PIN 12</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">int32_t</span> <span class=\"n\">calibrate_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle_calibrate_button</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">digitalRead</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">CALIBRATE_PIN</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">calibrate_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">calibrate_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"n\">delta_time</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">calibrate_hold_time</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">HOLD_INTERVAL</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">SET_STATE</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">STATE_ACQUIRE_DOWN_DIRECTION</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// reset the Z-Axis so it is acquired again</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">vzero</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">orientation</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// Clear all state flags</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">CLR_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">HOLD_MAX_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">CLR_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">PITCH_WARN_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">CLR_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ROLL_WARN_FLAG</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The calibration data are the <code>xaxis</code>, <code>yaxis</code> and <code>zaxis</code> vectors determined from the calibration.

As an experienced software engineer, the software itself was not a big challenge, but soldering everything together and preparing the enclosure was something that I did for the first time. You can see that from the quality of my soldering and the enclosure cutouts, but I did gain some experience from doing it. On the software side, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount and complexity of the code that the Arduino environment can handle. When I first contemplated the project I thought, I would have to leave out the nice Arduino libraries and program everything as low level AVR code to access the hardware registers and use fixed point math for the vector and matrix calculations. However, this was not the case: the entire program is written using high level libraries and functions, which is very nice.</p>\n\n<p>The source code for this project is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/Arduino_Inclinometer\">GitHub</a>, a <a href=\"/2017/12/arduino-inclinometer.html\">previous blog post</a> describes the parts list and hardware connections, the required Arduino libraries and how to build the software.</p>") (u .

This is a 24 week program incorporating both long runs and interval sessions. In the past 24 weeks I had 97 running sessions, 1347 kilometers in 122 hours. This is not much, as far as marathon training goes, but work and family obligations limited my training time.</p>\n\n<p>The plots below show the data I monitored during my training, they were &ldquo;evolving&rdquo; during my training, but now that the training is complete, they will not change anymore. The plots were created in <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">ActivityLog2</a>, which is the application I use to analyze my training data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"time-and-distance-by-week\">Time and distance by week</h2>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;weekly mileage&rdquo; is one of the basic tools used to track training.

While the actual heart rate range for each zone is specific to an individual, the zones themselves attempt to classify the effort into categories, like: <em>z0</em> is very easy, <em>z1</em> is easy, <em>z2</em> is somewhat hart, <em>z3</em> is hard, <em>z4</em> is very hard and <em>z5</em> is extreme (one can hold a <em>z5</em> effort for a few minutes only).</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"./Run_VOL_2017.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"pace-and-heart-rate-distribution\">Pace and Heart Rate Distribution</h2>\n\n<p>The graphs below show how much time I spent running at different speeds and heart rates. The colors represent zones, the same as the ones used in the &ldquo;running time by week&rdquo; graph.</p>\n\n<p>There are two peaks in each plot, this is because most of the training comprised of long slow runs and some of it running at threshold intervals. Looking at the graphs, my &ldquo;slow&rdquo; running pace is about 5:30/km at a heart rate of 162 BPM and my threshold running speed is about 4:30/km at a heart rate of about 180 BPM.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a002/Run_Pace_Hist_2017.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a002/Run_HR_Hist_2017.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"critical-velocity\">Critical Velocity</h2>\n\n<p>The critical velocity plot shows the best running pace I could maintain for a specific duration (the blue line), as well as the theoretical <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/master/doc/critical-power.md\">critical velocity</a>, (the red dashed line).</p>\n\n<p>The line goes up with duration because the plot shows the running pace: lower values mean slower running (4:00 min/km is faster than 5:00 min/km). There is a big drop in performance around 1h 30m mark, because this was the maximum length of interval training sessions. All the longer runs were done at an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pace. There is another big drop around the 2h 45m mark, this was the longest training run I did, the remaining of the line represents my actual marathon race and the overall time for that was much slower than my training runs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a002/Run_CV_2017.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The critical velocity concept allows estimating best efforts for specific durations, even if there is no &lsquo;best&rsquo; effort in the actual data for that duration.

"\n<p>A Racket implementation of a data frame structure, which allows efficient manipulation of data that is organized in rows and columns. It was originally written as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">ActivityLog2</a> project, than moved into its own Racket package.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>You can install the package using <code>raco pkg install data-frame</code>, browse the <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/data-frame/index.html\">reference documentation</a> or visit the project page on <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/data-frame\">GitHub</a>. The examples below illustrate some more complex things that can be done with this package.</p>\n\n<p>The data-frame package was developed to help analyzing fitness data recorded by Garmin devices. A fitness device, such as a bike computer or a running watch, will usually record data at 1 second interval. Each recording will contain information about the speed, GPS position, heart rate, cadence, power and several other parameters. A 2 hour bike ride will contain 7200 such data points and each data point will contain up to about 40 measurements. Someone serious about training will record more than 200 such activities each year. The size of this data set requires some careful thought about how to keep data in memory so it can be analyzed and visualized efficiently, and the data frame representation came out of this requirement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-frame-object-overview\">Data frame object overview</h2>\n\n<p>The data in the data-frame object can be viewed as a 2 dimensional table with rows and columns. Each column is called a &ldquo;series&rdquo;, which consists of a name and the actual data. The package contains operations for selecting subsets of the data, both on rows and columns, efficient search and indexing, plus helper functions to calculate statistics values and generate various plots.</p>\n\n<p>The following examples are from the ActivityLog2 application and all use a data frame loaded for a session, however data can also be loaded into the data frame from SQL databases using <code>df-read/sql</code> or from CSV files using <code>df-read/csv</code>. The following prelude is assumed, which will load the data frame for session id 1816 from the default database:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n

GPS data. The map widget works directly with sequences of LAT/LONG data points, however it is more convenient to be able to load GPS tracks from files. To facilitate the examples presented here, I wrote a small library to read data from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format\">GPX</a> files. This is not meant to be a complete GPX file reader, but only to support the examples presented here. The library provides the following functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><code>gpx-load</code> &mdash; loads data from a GPX file. It returns a vector of track  points, each track point being a 5 element vector: latitude, longitude,  current distance, elevation and timestamp</li>\n <li><code>gpx-lookup-position</code> &mdash; returns the position (latitude/longitude) of the  point at a specified distance from the start of the track. The position is  interpolated between two points available in the track data.</li>\n <li><code>gpx-lookup-elevation</code> &mdash; returns the elevation of a point at a specified  distance from the start of the track. This elevation is interpolated  between two points available on the track data.</li>\n <li><code>gpx-total-distance</code> &mdash; returns the total distance (length of the track)</li></ul>\n\n<p>The GPX library is available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/c79921a975088f4a4d10116fcf19c34d\">in this GitHub gist</a> (it is just a single file), and the entire demo code is available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/c79921a975088f4a4d10116fcf19c34d\">in this other gist</a>. The GPX file used in the example can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zYFtEGdT4nw8yG4Db7xHqkqo38v9Y_e5\">Google Drive</a>.</p>\n<!-- link definitions-->") (u .

"\n<p>It is no surprise to anyone who tried to run in the heat that it is harder than when the outdoor temperature is more pleasant. But how much harder is it, and how can this be quantified? With summer in full swing in the southern hemisphere, I decided to take a look at how running is affected by temperature.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>Between 2011 and today, I have recorded 741 running sessions in my <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">ActivityLog2</a> database. Out of these sessions, some were run without my Garmin watch and for some of them either the GPS or the heart rate monitor has misbehaved, recording invalid data. This has left me with 700 sessions for which I have accurate speed, heart rate and weather data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"temperature\">Temperature</h2>\n\n<p>In Western Australia we have plenty of hot days, especially during summer. Whenever possible, I try to run when the temperature outside is reasonable, but this is not always possible. Below is the distribution of my running sessions with regards to outdoor temperature, as you can see I prefer to run when the temperature outside is between about 18 and 23 ℃.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a007/temperature-hist.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>Temperature does not tell the whole story about how it feels outside: humidity and barometric pressure also have an influence on the comfort level. Many weather applications can show a &ldquo;feels like&rdquo; temperature which takes into account humidity and barometric pressure. There are several formulas for calculating this &ldquo;feels like&rdquo; temperature. I experimented with several of them and I decided to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidex\">Humidex</a>, mainly because it can be simply calculated and it matched my own perceived feel for the temperature. I have been using Humidex for a while now, and every time I record a run, I check this value to see if it seems OK. So far, I have been happy with this formula. Below is a distribution of my running sessions with regards to Humidex. Compared to the temperature distribution, the entire plot is shifted to the right, indicating that the &ldquo;feels like&rdquo; temperature for my runs is a lot warmer that temperature would indicate. It seems that the &ldquo;feels like&rdquo; temperature when I prefer to run is somewhere between 21 and 26 ℃.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a007/humidex-hist.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"efficiency-factor\">Efficiency Factor</h2>\n\n<p>We need a metric to describe the efficiency of running and compare it with temperature. A good metric seems to be <a href=\"https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/efficiency-factor-and-decoupling/\">efficiency factor</a> which is simply the ratio of the <em>running speed</em> and <em>heart rate</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>EF = Running_Speed / Heart_Rate\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ratio ties together the <strong>effort</strong> required by the run, as measured by the <strong>heart rate</strong> and the <strong>power output</strong> of the run, as measured by the <strong>running speed</strong>. An individual EF value has no meaning, and EF values cannot be compared between two athletes, but tracking the EF for an individual athlete can show if they are improving or not: maintaining the same running speed at a lower heart rate means that the athlete has improved and will result in a higher EF. An increased EF can also result from being able to maintain a higher running speed at the same heart rate.</p>\n\n<p>The efficiency factor is a great metric, since it is independent of the type of run: a high intensity run will have a higher average heart rate than a slow easy run, but it will also have a higher speed, so the overall EF of these two running sessions should be about the same. It will never be probably identical, since heart rate is affected by other factors such as outdoor temperature and how fresh or tired the athlete is.</p>\n\n<p>Another factor that can influence EF is how hilly the running course is: when running uphill, the running speed will decrease while heart rate will increase (to put it differently, it is harder to run uphill than it is on the flat). In such a case, EF will be lower than if running on a flat course. To compensate for this, the notion of <strong>grade adjusted pace</strong> (GAP) is introduced: this takes into account the running speed and the current slope and produces an equivalent speed as if the run happened on flat ground. When running uphill, GAP will be higher than the actual pace, while running downhill it will be lower. As with \"feels like&rsquo; temperature, there are several algorithms for GAP, the one I implemented is the one from Strava, which you can find described <a href=\"https://medium.com/strava-engineering/an-improved-gap-model-8b07ae8886c3\">here</a>. When calculating EF, the speed is first adjusted for grade, this ensures that the calculated EF values take into account how hilly the running course was.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"comparing-efficiency-factor-with-temperature\">Comparing efficiency factor with temperature</h2>\n\n<p>I calculated the efficiency factor for all my running sessions and plotted them against the &ldquo;feels like&rdquo; temperature for the run. This is the gray dot could in the plot below. There are several EF values for each temperature, except the extremes where there are only a few data points. This is because EF actually tracks fitness level and over the 6 years of data my fitness level varied quite a bit, being low at the start of a season and high at the end of the season. To smooth things out, I calculated the average EF for all sessions at a certain temperature, these re the big orange dots on the plot. It is now quite apparent that there is a correlation between the efficiency factor and temperature. I fitted a second degree polynomial over these data points to obtain a smooth line (the blue dashed line) on the plot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a007/humidex-ga-ef-scatter.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The fitted polynomial allows estimating the efficiency factor given a temperature value as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>EF = 1.8347990118 + 0.0114733678 * humidex - 0.0002975829 * (humidex ^ 2)</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above formula indicates that the maximum EF of 1.95 is at 19.28 ℃, so this is the optimal temperature for me to run &mdash; intuitively, this is about right. We can do more with this formula, for example, we can determine how much HR increases with temperature if the same running speed is maintained (EF ratio represents the percentage of EF drop when compare to the best EF at 19.28 ℃):</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>19.28 ℃</td>\n    <td>20 ℃</td>\n    <td>25 ℃</td>\n    <td>30 ℃</td>\n    <td>35 ℃</td>\n    <td>40 ℃</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>EF</td>\n    <td>1.95</td>\n    <td>1.95</td>\n    <td>1.94</td>\n    <td>1.91</td>\n    <td>1.87</td>\n    <td>1.82</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>EF ratio</td>\n    <td>100%</td>\n    <td>100%</td>\n    <td>99.5%</td>\n    <td>98.2%</td>\n    <td>96.2%</td>\n    <td>93.4%</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>HR</td>\n    <td>150</td>\n    <td>150</td>\n    <td>151</td>\n    <td>153</td>\n    <td>156</td>\n    <td>161</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>HR</td>\n    <td>160</td>\n    <td>160</td>\n    <td>161</td>\n    <td>163</td>\n    <td>166</td>\n    <td>171</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>HR</td>\n    <td>170</td>\n    <td>170</td>\n    <td>171</td>\n    <td>173</td>\n    <td>177</td>\n    <td>182</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we can determine how much running speed will have to decrease to keep a constant heart rate when temperature increases:</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>19.28 ℃</td>\n    <td>20 ℃</td>\n    <td>25 ℃</td>\n    <td>30 ℃</td>\n    <td>35 ℃</td>\n    <td>40 ℃</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>EF</td>\n    <td>1.95</td>\n    <td>1.95</td>\n    <td>1.94</td>\n    <td>1.91</td>\n    <td>1.87</td>\n    <td>1.82</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>EF ratio</td>\n    <td>100%</td>\n    <td>100%</td>\n    <td>99.5%</td>\n    <td>98.2%</td>\n    <td>96.2%</td>\n    <td>93.4%</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Pace (min/km)</td>\n    <td>6:00</td>\n    <td>6:00</td>\n    <td>6:02</td>\n    <td>6:06</td>\n    <td>6:14</td>\n    <td>6:25</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Pace (min/km)</td>\n    <td>5:00</td>\n    <td>5:00</td>\n    <td>5:02</td>\n    <td>5:05</td>\n    <td>5:12</td>\n    <td>5:21</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Pace (min/km)</td>\n    <td>4:30</td>\n    <td>4:30</td>\n    <td>4:31</td>\n    <td>4:35</td>\n    <td>4:41</td>\n    <td>4:49</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Pace (min/km)</td>\n    <td>4:00</td>\n    <td>4:00</td>\n    <td>4:01</td>\n    <td>4:04</td>\n    <td>4:09</td>\n    <td>4:17</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>So how useful is this? The above data is from a single athlete (me), and I am acclimatized to heat, as I live in a hot climate. The above values match my empirical experience on how to adjust my running as the heat increases.</p>\n\n<p>How about <strong>running in the cold</strong>?

The accuracy of the roll and pitch readings depended on how precisely the unit is mounted inside the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The model that I built uses the same parts list, but the Arduino Sketch can determine the orientation of the unit, so the unit can be installed in any position inside the vehicle: mine was attached with a piece of Velcro tape to the dash board.</p>\n\n<p>Since the unit can be mounted in any position, the &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction read from the accelerometer will not be a reading of 1 for the Z axis, instead it will be an arbitrary reading of the X, Y, and Z axis values. When the unit is powered up, it will determine its &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction &mdash; this requires the vehicle to be on a flat surface. Once it knows the down direction it can determine the forward direction when the vehicle moves forward, as some acceleration applied to the unit. The forward direction can also be acquired by starting to move the vehicle and than immediately braking hard. With the &ldquo;down&rdquo; and &ldquo;forward&rdquo; directions acquired the unit can now interpret any accelerometer reading relative to these directions so it is being able to correctly determine the pitch and roll and display it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"source-code\">Source Code</h2>\n\n<p>The source code for the project is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/Arduino_Inclinometer\">GitHub</a>.

Here is why: for each axis, the accelerometer can read a value between &ndash;1024 and +1024. The maximum acceleration range can be specified at initialization time, and for this application is set to 4 G. This means that, when 4 G of acceleration is applied to one of the X, Y or Z axes, the accelerometer should read 1024 (if 4 G is applied in the opposite direction, it should read &ndash;1024). If 1G is applied to the same axis, the accelerometer should read 1024/4 = 256.</p>\n\n<p>The 1 G case is easy to test, since this is the Earths gravity. If you place the accelerometer flat on the table, 1 G of acceleration is applied to the Z axis, and zero acceleration on the X (forward) and Y (left) axis. If I do this experiment with my unit I get the following readings: &ldquo;X = 5; Y = &ndash;27; Z = 226&rdquo;. In fact, no matter how much I adjust the position of the accelerometer, I was never able to obtain the expected &ldquo;X = 0; Y = 0; Z = 256&rdquo; reading.</p>\n\n<p>The calibration process obtains two adjustment values for each axis, a <strong>slope</strong> and an <strong>intercept</strong>. These values are used to adjust the value read from the accelerometer so that it will read &ndash;256 if &ndash;1 G is applied to an axis and +256 if +1 G is applied to that axis.</p>\n\n<p>The calibration process described here is somewhat simplistic, but it works in this case because it is used to determine roll and pitch when there is little or no acceleration applied above the Earths gravity. The advantage of this process is that it is simple enough to perform and requires no extra tools or calibration rig. If the accelerometer is used to actually measure larger accelerations, a different process will need to be used &mdash; you will need to search the net for a better process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-perform-the-calibration-and-determine-the-slope-and-intercept\">How to perform the calibration and determine the slope and intercept</h3>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> calibration should be performed after the unit has been assembled and soldered on the final PCB, as soldering will change the calibration values.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a006/inclinometer_assembled.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/Arduino_Inclinometer/blob/master/calibration/calibration.ino\">calibration sketch</a> can help with the calibration process. This sketch prints out the raw accelerometer readings for the X, Y and Z axis. To view the values, open the serial monitor window on the Arduino IDE and make sure the serial speed is set to 38400 baud.</p>\n\n<p>With this sketch running, six readings must be obtained from the accelerometer, two for each axis. The accelerometer module has the X and Y axes printed on the PCB, it may help to locate them now. Here are the six readings, when the accelerometer is placed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>flat on the table (Z axis pointing up), adjust it until you obtain the  maximum reading for the Z axis and make a note of it.</li>\n <li>upside down on the table (Z axis pointing down), adjust it until you obtain  the minimum reading for the Z axis and make a note of it.</li>\n <li>standing on the table (X axis pointing up), read the maximum value for the  X axis</li>\n <li>standing upside-down on the table (X axis pointing down), read the minimum  value for the X axis</li>\n <li>sideways on the table (Y axis pointing up), read the maximum value for the  Y axis</li>\n <li>sideways upside-down on the table (Y axis pointing down), read the minimum  value for the Y axis</li></ol>\n\n<p>Than, for each axis, a <strong>slope</strong> and <strong>intercept</strong> value can be calculated using the following formulas:</p>\n\n<pre><code>slope = 2 / (max_reading - min_reading)\nintercept = 1 - slope * min_reading\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For my accelerometer unit, I had the following readings and <strong>slope</strong> and <strong>intercept</strong> values:</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">Axis</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Min Reading</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Max Reading</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Slope</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Intercept</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">X</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">&ndash;245</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">258</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">0.003976143</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">&ndash;0.02584493</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">Y</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">&ndash;275</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">232</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">0.003944773</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">0.084812623</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">Z</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">&ndash;275</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">230</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">0.003960396</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">0.089108911</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>The slope and intercept values for each axis must be placed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/Arduino_Inclinometer/blob/master/inclinometer/inclinometer.ino\">inclinometer.ino</a> file, replacing the values that are already present there.

We read from the accelerometer three values, the acceleration on the X (forward &mdash; backward), Y (left &mdash; right) and Z (up &mdash; down) axes. Together, these values from a single 3 - dimensional, or 3 D, vector. The following operations are defined on vectors in the code.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>vlen</code> function calculates the length, or magnitude, of a 3 D vector. In our case, this represents the absolute acceleration applied to the unit, regardless of the direction. If the unit is at rest, the <code>vlen</code> of any accelerometer reading should be 1, as 1 G of acceleration is applied to the unit regardless of its orientation.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>vnormalize</code> function returns a new vector with the same direction as the original one, but with a length of 1, also called a <em>unit vector</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>vdot</code> function calculates the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product\">dot product</a> of two vectors. The dot product has an important property for our application: the dot product of two <em>unit vectors</em> represents the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. This means we can determine the angle the unit is facing by using the dot product of the accelerometer reading and the &ldquo;down direction&rdquo; vector, which is (0, 0, 1).</p>\n\n<p>The <code>vcross</code> function calculates the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product\">cross product</a> of two vectors. The cross product has an important property for our application: the cross product of two vectors results in a vector that is perpendicular (at a right angle) to the plane of the first two vectors. This means we can determine a true forward direction even though, when accelerating the vehicle the vector read from the accelerometer will not point exactly forward or backward.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reading-an-orientation-vector-from-the-accelerometer-module\">Reading an orientation vector from the accelerometer module</h3>\n\n<p>The accelerometer values can be read using the <code>getX</code>, <code>getY</code> and <code>getZ</code> methods of the <code>adxl345</code> module, however these are raw, uncalibrated values (see <em>Calibration</em> section above) and the values fluctuate very quickly by small amounts. Using these values directly would result in the angle reading always flickering the last digit when displayed.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>read_accelerometer</code> function defined below reads the values from the accelerometer as a 3 D vector, but applies the calibration <em>slope</em> and <em>intercept</em> values and than filters them using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter\">low pass filter</a>. Unlike a rolling average filter, a low pass filter only requires a single extra vector to be kept in the global state. This is important, as the sketch uses up almost all the memory on the Arduino Nano board.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_accelerometer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">output</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// The filtered accelerometer values.

To do that, it assumes that the unit is not moving and the vehicle is on a flat surface (note that most roads have a 2 &ndash; 3 degree camber, so the side of the road is not a flat surface).</p>\n\n<p>The down direction is stored in the global <code>zaxis</code> vector. Each reading, the function checks if the dot product between the <code>zaxis</code> and the current reading, <code>cal</code>, is approximately 1. Since <code>cos(0)</code> is 1, a dot product of 1 means the angle between <code>zaxis</code> and <code>cal</code> is 0, so the two vectors point in the same direction. In our case, this means that we had multiple readings of the same &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction. Note that this assumes that both <code>zaxis</code> and <code>cal</code> are <em>unit vectors</em>, which will be the case if the vehicle is stationary and only the Earths gravity is applied to it.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>cal</code> and <code>zaxis</code> are not pointing in the same direction, the <code>zaxis</code> is updated to be &ldquo;between&rdquo; the previous <code>zaxis</code> and the new <code>cal</code> reading. Effectively, <code>zaxis</code> is slowly moved towards the <code>cal</code> reading.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">on_acquire_down_direction</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">dot</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">vdot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dot</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.99</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"n\">dot</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"mf\">1.01</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">vnormalize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n        <span class=\"c1\">// Got our down direction, we can now determine the forward direction.</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">SET_STATE</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">STATE_ACQUIRE_FORWARD_DIRECTION</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zaxis</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.5</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n        <span class=\"c1\">// Show a message on the screen that we are acquiring the down</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// direction.</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"acquiring-the-forward-direction\">Acquiring the forward direction</h3>\n\n<p>Once the &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction is known, the forward direction can be determined by moving the vehicle forward.

The &ldquo;length&rdquo; of the vector represents the total acceleration applied to the unit, 1 G is always applied because of Earths gravity and 0.02 is applied from the vehicles acceleration. The acceleration vector will also point slightly backwards now, since the vehicle&rsquo;s forward acceleration is combined with the &ldquo;down&rdquo; acceleration from gravity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> it is also possible to start moving the vehicle and brake hard to get a negative acceleration (deceleration). The end result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>We now have two reference vectors, one that points down, <code>zaxis</code>, and one that points down and slightly backwards. The <em>cross product</em> of these two vectors is a vector that points straight to the left of the unit, this is the <code>yaxis</code>. Finally, the <em>cross product</em> between the <code>yaxis</code> and <code>zaxis</code> is a vector that points forward, the <code>xaxis</code>. The two new vectors are also normalized, as the length of the vector produced by the <em>cross product</em> is not necessarily 1.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: c++\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">on_acquire_forward_direction</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">float</span> <span class=\"n\">gforce</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">vlen</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">cal</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">gforce</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mf\">1.02</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// 0.02 of acceleration indicates that the vehicle is moving and we</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// can determine the forward direction.

This is necessary, since it it designed to be moved around instead of being mounted in a fixed place. However, it means that the unit has to be powered up when the vehicle is on a flat surface. A possible improvement is to mount the unit inside the vehicle in a fixed position, perform the calibration only once and store the <code>xaxis</code>, <code>yaxis</code> and <code>zaxis</code> vectors into EEPROM. This way, the unit can simply retrieve these values from the EEPROM.</p>\n\n<p>Another improvement is to place the <em>slope</em> and <em>intercept</em> calibration values in EEPROM, so that the sketch code does not have to change for each unit being built.</p>\n\n<p>The above improvements would be a challenge, as the memory used by the sketch is already too high. When compiling the sketch, I got the following message from the Arduino compiler:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Sketch uses 19538 bytes (63%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.</p>\n <p>Global variables use 1737 bytes (84%) of dynamic memory, leaving 311 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.</p>\n <p>Low memory available, stability problems may occur.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The code itself is not very complex and does not use a lot of memory, but the OLED display requires a back buffer to hold the image. Since I used a 128 x 64 pixel display, it required a back buffer of 8192 bits (since the display is monochrome), or 1024 bytes of RAM. Given that the ATmega328P has 2048 bytes of ram, 50% of the memory is used up by the OLED back-buffer.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining 311 bytes for local variables, means that this space is used to hold the stack variables for function calls. If the function call stack is too deep, it will start writing into the global variables, corrupting the program. Fortunately, this is not the case for this sketch, but it does illustrate the problem that adding a display to a small micro-controller will severely reduce the complexity of the programs it can run.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Update 10 Mar 2018</strong> There is an updated <a href=\"/2018/03/arduino-inclinometer-improvements.html\">blog post</a> with some improvements I made to the unit.

They are installed as part of the normal Racket installation, which racket calls &ldquo;installation scope&rdquo;. To modify that installation, administrator privileges are needed. Alternatively, the packages can be installed in the &ldquo;user scope&rdquo;, as shown in the commands below. Running these commands below will some time as packages and dependencies are rebuilt:</p>\n\n<pre><code>raco pkg install --force --scope user --catalog https://pkgs.racket-lang.org plot\nraco pkg install --force --scope user --catalog https://pkgs.racket-lang.org plot-lib\nraco pkg install --force --scope user --catalog https://pkgs.racket-lang.org plot-gui-lib\nraco pkg install --force --scope user --catalog https://pkgs.racket-lang.org plot-doc</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"clone-the-plot-repository-from-github-and-link-the-packages\">Clone the plot repository from GitHub and link the packages</h2>\n\n<p>Next step is to clone the plot package using the command below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/racket/plot.git\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will give access to the source code and we can now tell racket to use the source code inside the repository for the packages. This is done using a &ldquo;raco pkg update&rdquo; command. Note that there is a trailing slash at the end of the package names: without it, the package name will be looked up in the catalog instead of the specified directory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cd plot\nraco pkg update plot-lib/\nraco pkg update plot-gui-lib/</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, we can check that the plot packages are indeed installed in a git clone and can be modified:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ raco pkg show --all --long --rx 'plot-.*'\nInstallation-wide:\n Package[*=auto]    Checksum                                    Source\n plot-compat*       cfae0fb19a8c83d6f756cea9d9815f50bb170e05    (catalog \"plot-compat\")\n plot-doc*          74c466400fb4ece74cef869f3d02d81fb176ff7c    (catalog \"plot-doc\")\n plot-gui-lib*      7ef4b214d028877e9d0003e357d77bd7e94db967    (catalog \"plot-gui-lib\")\n plot-lib*          8408c8d63a94ee2cd57713c40fd7e68525107014    (catalog \"plot-lib\")\nUser-specific for installation \"6.11\":\n Package         Checksum    Source\n plot-gui-lib    #f          (link \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Alex\\\\rkt-libs\\\\plot\\\\plot-gui-lib\")\n plot-lib        #f          (link \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Alex\\\\rkt-libs\\\\plot\\\\plot-lib\")</code></pre>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;plot-gui-lib&rdquo; and &ldquo;plot-lib&rdquo; packages are listed twice. This is because the second installation is in &ldquo;user scope&rdquo;. These packages are also listed as being linked to a directory where we cloned the plot package. Since the user scope is searched first, racket will load these packages from the git repository. The source for these packages can now be modified and racket will pick up the changes automatically.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switching-git-remotes\">Switching git remotes</h2>\n\n<p>In the step above, the main plot package was cloned. Unless you have push access to that repository, it is better to switch to your own fork. Assuming the plot package is already forked on GitHub, the origin branch can be renamed to upstream:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git remote rename origin upstream\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>&hellip; and the fork added as the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; remote:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git add remote origin git@github.com:alex-hhh/plot.git\n</code></pre>") (u .

This name is misleading, as we are not defining a <code>class%</code>, but an instance of the <code>snip-class%</code> object. This &ldquo;snip class&rdquo; is used when serializing snips from the pasteboard. We won&rsquo;t use this functionality here, but we still need to define one. Since we don&rsquo;t use serialization facilities the definition is very simple, and shown below. The class name, as passed to <code>set-classname</code> needs to be unique between all the snip classes used by the application:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-piece-snip-class</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._make-object))\" style=\"color: inherit\">make-object</a></span>\n   <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip-class%</span>\n     <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._super-new))\" style=\"color: inherit\">super-new</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n     <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">set-classname</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"chess-piece-snip\"</span><span class=\"p\">))))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The snip class object needs to be registered with the Racket editor gui, and this is done using the call below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre>1</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">get-the-snip-class-list</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">add</span> <span class=\"n\">chess-piece-snip-class</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>We will use a single snip class for all chess pieces, since the only difference between them is how they are displayed. To have a minimal working snip, three things need to be present in the derived class:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>a call to <code>set-snipclass</code> which associates the snip instance with the snip  class that was previously defined</li>\n <li>a <code>get-extent</code> method which the <code>pasteboard%</code> uses to determine the size of  the snip</li>\n <li>a <code>draw</code> method, which is used to draw the snip onto the pasteboard canvas.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Our <code>chess-piece%</code> snip class receives three arguments in the constructor: a <code>glyph</code>, which is a string representing the Unicode character for the piece, a <code>font</code> used to render the glyph and a <code>size</code> which is the size in pixels of the chess piece (since the piece is a square it will have the same width and height). The font object could already determine the size of the piece, but a separate size parameter allows us to define chess pieces that are larger than the glyph that they display (as an exercise, you can experiment with different variations of font and size in the <code>make-chess-piece</code> defined later).</p>\n\n<p>The <code>get-extent</code> method is used by the <code>pasteboard%</code> to obtain the dimensions of the snip. The implementation is straightforward, as it just reports the <code>size</code> as both the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, but the actual method call is somewhat unusual: a device context, <code>dc</code> is passed in, together with the position of the snip on the canvas as the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates, in return, the <code>pasteboard%</code> expects the <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> and some other parameters to be filled in by our object (the other parameters have to do with snips that are part of a text editor and represent text, they don&rsquo;t concern us here, so they are set to 0). The method is somewhat unusual as it uses <code>box</code>-es for the output parameters, so we need to use <code>box-set!</code> to set the output value.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>draw</code> method is used to paint the snip contents onto the canvas. It receives the device context, <code>dc</code> and the snip position on the canvas. The method also receives other parameters which would allow re-drawing only the parts of the snip that actually need updating, but our code always draws the entire snip contents. Our implementation simply draws the glyph in the middle of the snip area, but nothing else, so the actual snip appears transparent, with only the chess piece being drawn.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush:

Since the chess board itself is static and the user does not interact with it, this approach is the simplest. The <code>on-paint</code> method is invoked twice during each repaint: once before the snips are painted and once after. The <code>before?</code> parameter tells us which invocation it is. The method also receives a device context, <code>dc</code>, plus some other parameters which determine the area that needs repainting &mdash; these parameters would help in speeding up complex redraw operations, but since our drawing needs are simple, we just redraw the entire board every time. Our implementation simply calls the <code>draw-chess-board</code> function (defined later) when the <code>on-paint</code> is invoked to draw the background:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._super-new))\" style=\"color: inherit\">super-new</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/override))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/override</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">on-paint</span> <span class=\"n\">before?</span> <span class=\"n\">dc</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span> <span class=\"n\">other</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/when_unless.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._when))\" style=\"color: inherit\">when</a></span> <span class=\"n\">before?</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">draw-chess-board</span> <span class=\"n\">dc</span><span class=\"p\">)))))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>draw-chess-board</code> function is shown below. It paints the checkered pattern of the board on the entire size of the device context, which is the canvas area. To assist the player identifying squares in chess notation, such as &ldquo;d3&rdquo;, it also paints the rank and file values on the left and bottom edges.</p>\n\n<p>A few points about this code are worth mentioning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>The racket device context based drawing follows the same principles as in  any other language that uses such device contexts: drawing resources such as  brushes, pens and fonts must be created and set on the device context and  draw operations such as <code>draw-rectangle</code>, or <code>draw-text</code> use the last set  drawing resource.</li>\n <li>Creating drawing resources, such as <code>pen%</code>, <code>brush%</code> and <code>font%</code> objects  directly is expensive, so Racket provides a &ldquo;manager&rdquo; type object which only  creates them as needed:<code>the-pen-list</code>, <code>the-brush-list</code>, <code>the-font-list</code>.  Because of this, we don&rsquo;t need to keep these objects around in the class, we  can simply retrieve them every time <code>draw-chess-board</code> is invoked.</li>\n <li>The method clears the device context before drawing &mdash; since the method is  supposed to cover the entire area of the board and we only draw the &ldquo;black&rdquo;  squares, this is the simplest method to ensure that no previous image data  is left over from previous drawing operations.</li>\n <li>The code does not assume that the board is a certain size, or even that it  is a rectangle. Instead, it determines the size dynamically and calculates  the explicit width and height of each square, as well as the positions of  the labels. This is helpful, this function will not have to change if a  chess board of a different size is created, and will also handle dynamic  resizes of the canvas.</li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"brush:

In addition to this, the chess game uses a &ldquo;rank&rdquo; and &ldquo;file&rdquo; coordinate system, where the <em>rank</em> represents the row on the board and it is numbered from 1 to 8, 1 being at the bottom, while the <em>file</em> are the columns of the board, labeled using letters from &ldquo;a&rdquo; to &ldquo;h&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Since each chess piece needs to know its location, we can store it directly into the <code>chess-piece%</code> object, as the <code>location</code> field with as setter and getter method. We allow the location to be <code>#f</code> which represents a piece that is not on the board. <code>make-chess-piece</code> will also have to be updated to allow passing an optional location to the created chess piece</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-piece%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip%</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._init-field))\" style=\"color: inherit\">init-field</a></span> <span class=\"n\">glyph</span> <span class=\"n\">font</span> <span class=\"n\">size</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/index.html#(def._((lib._xml/main..rkt)._location))\" style=\"color: inherit\">location</a></span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/public))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/public</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">set-location</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/set_.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._set!))\" style=\"color: inherit\">set!</a></span> <span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/index.html#(def._((lib._xml/main..rkt)._location))\" style=\"color: inherit\">location</a></span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/public))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/public</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">get-location</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/index.html#(def._((lib._xml/main..rkt)._location))\" style=\"color: inherit\">location</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">;; rest of the chess-piece% remains the same</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>The chess pieces are added to the chess board using the <code>insert</code> method, which allows placing a snip at any coordinate, or at (0, 0) if no coordinates are specified.

board is resized, the pieces will stay in place, instead of moving with their respective squares. We can fix this by repositioning the pieces when the board is resized: the <code>on-display-size</code> method is q called when the canvas changes size, and inside it we can iterate over all the snips in the pasteboard and simply call <code>position-piece</code> for each one. Since <code>position-piece</code> looks at the location of a piece (&ldquo;d3&rdquo;, &ldquo;f5&rdquo;, etc) and always takes the current canvas size into consideration, it will move the piece at its correct location. The code that repositions the snip pieces is also wrapped in <code>begin-edit-sequence</code>/<code>end-edit-sequence</code> method calls on the pasteboard. These calls ensure that the pasteboard will not be refreshed while the snips are moved and it will only be refreshed at the end after all snips were moved to their new locations. It is a good idea to wrap any code that modifies more than one snip in a <code>begin-edit-sequence</code>/<code>end-edit-sequence</code> block, otherwise the pasteboard will refresh more than necessary and graphics performance will be poor.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/augment))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/augment</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">on-display-size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">begin-edit-sequence</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/let.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._let))\" style=\"color: inherit\">let</a></span> <span class=\"n\">loop</span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">find-first-snip</span><span class=\"p\">)])</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/when_unless.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._when))\" style=\"color: inherit\">when</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span>\n          <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">position-piece</span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n          <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">loop</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"n\">next</span><span class=\"p\">))))</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">end-edit-sequence</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n      \n    <span class=\"c1\">;; rest of the chess-board% definition remains the same</span>\n\n    <span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can find the updated program in this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/96604c1a01b9ae77e5f1227536f6cb67\">GitHub Gist</a> and if you run it you will get the result as shown below.

Different vendors also provide monthly subscriptions for more sophisticated training applications. However, I find it more interesting and challenging to write my own application to control the trainer. In doing so, I learned how to communicate with ANT+ devices, how to extend the <code class=\"brush: racket\">pasteboard%</code> object to display a map on the background and a few things about the GPX tracks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"running-the-application\">Running the application</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment</strong> You need the following equipment to run the application:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>An ANT+ FE-C capable bike trainer (all recent trainers should work)</li>\n <li>A bike to put on the trainer</li>\n <li>An ANT+ Heart Rate Monitor (optional)</li>\n <li>An ANT+ USB dongle</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>GPX Track</strong> You will also need a GPX file, which contains the GPS track to ride. If you don&rsquo;t have any, here are two sample ones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1_EvQnSEBy6fcjYKqcENYJKf1wWaojWyZ\">Guilford Hills</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1jlOLyG0MXTezoSwCdSGWDiaFO9MolRj8\">Mt Adelaide and Clarence</a></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Telemetry Server</strong> Communicating with the application is done using a separate application, a <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/TrainerControl\">TelemetryServer</a>. Follow the instructions in that projects README file to build and run it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong> for the application is on the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/tree/bike-trainer\">bike-trainer branch</a> of the ActivityLog2 project, with all relevant files in the <code>bike-trainer</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>To run the application, first start the telemetry server, than open the <code>bike-trainer.rkt</code> file in DrRacket and click &ldquo;Run&rdquo; (or Ctrl-R). You will need to connect to the telemetry server by typing the following in the Racket interaction window (7500 is the TCP port number it will connect to):</p>\n\n<pre><code>(connect 7500)</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once that is done, the live telemetry data should show up on the top of the window. You can load a GPX track, click &ldquo;Start&rdquo; and start pedaling. The current location should advance on the map and the trainer resistance will change depending on the slope at the current location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"running-the-application-in-demo-mode\">Running the application in demo mode</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>demo-telemetry-server.rkt</code> utility can be used to supply pre-defined telemetry values to the bike trainer application. This can be used to test the application without a bike trainer, or to simply run the application in demo mode.</p>\n\n<p>To run the server, you will need a CSV file with telemetry data. A CSV file in the required format can be exported by selecting an existing activity and using the &ldquo;Activity / Export track data (CSV)&hellip;&rdquo;. You can also download a sample CSV file <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1Zgzrj5IqER7Qf4AzrMc3i3gVa5ePqg_W\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The server can be run from the command line as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>racket demo-telemetry-server.rkt -f telemetry-data.csv</code></pre>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the server can send telemetry directly from an existing session from the ActivityLog2 database. You will need the session id, which you can find by opening a session and using the &ldquo;Activity/Copy session id to clipboard&hellip;&rdquo; menu item. You can than use the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>racket demo-telemetry-server.rkt -s SESSION-ID\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once started, the bike-trainer application will connect to this server to receive telemetry values.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1E2fSQFy7k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2>\n\n<p>The implementation is on the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/tree/bike-trainer\">bike-trainer branch</a> of the ActivityLog2 project, with all relevant files in the <code>bike-trainer</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the ActivityLog2 application, I already had the most important ingredient: a map widget with all the necessary map utilities. I decided to use a <code class=\"brush: racket\">pasteboard%</code> for the main application window, with the map being displayed as the background and all the other views implemented as <code class=\"brush: racket\">snip%</code> objects.</p>\n\n<p>A &ldquo;current location&rdquo; concept was added to the <code>map-widget%</code>: when a current location is set using <code>set-current-location</code>, a red circle will be drawn at that location. Also the current location is &ldquo;tracked&rdquo;, meaning that the map is slowly panned so that the current location is always displayed on the screen. This is currently non-configurable, see <code>track-current-location</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the <code>map-widget%</code> was updated to act as a <code>pasteboard%</code>. The map is drawn as the pasteboard background, and the pasteboard can be accessed using <code>get-pasteboard</code> and snips can be inserted. Mouse handling has changes: click and drag events are used to pan the map around and mouse events with the &ldquo;Control&rdquo; key pressed are passed to the pasteboard%. This means that selecting and moving snips around is done while the &ldquo;control&rdquo; key is pressed.</p>\n\n<p>Training data is overlaid on top of the map using snips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>a <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/bike-trainer/bike-trainer/telemetry-snip.rkt\">telemetry-snip%</a> is used for each of the telemetry values (heart  rate, power, speed, cadence, etc)</li>\n <li>an <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/bike-trainer/bike-trainer/elevation-profile-snip.rkt\">elevation-profile-snip%</a> is used to display the elevation  profile on the map</li>\n <li>a <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/bike-trainer/bike-trainer/message-snip.rkt\">message-snip%</a> is used to display messages</li></ul>\n\n<p>The simulation state (current location on the map and how it changes with the speed) is implemented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/bike-trainer/bike-trainer/sim-state.rkt\">sim-state.rkt</a> file. A <code>sim-state</code> structure is defined containing all relevant data for the simulation along with functions to update it. I decided to experiment with &ldquo;functional updating&rdquo; of the state: all update functions return a new updated simulation state, rather than updating the existing state. This has resulted in elegant code in the simulation-task (see below)</p>\n\n<p>The main application is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/bike-trainer/bike-trainer/bike-trainer.rkt\">bike-trainer.rkt</a> file, which sets up the widgets and starts the <code>simulation-task</code> procedure in a separate thread. This procedure reads telemetry data from the trainer and updates the simulation state.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"communicating-with-the-trainer\">Communicating with the trainer</h3>\n\n<p>The bike trainer sends and receives data using the wireless ANT+ protocol, the same as my heart rate monitor and power meter on the bike. On the PC side, the data is sent and received using an ANT+ USB dongle (an ANT Stick). The ANT+ protocol documentation is available from <a href=\"https://www.thisisant.com\">www.thisisant.com</a>, although you have to sign up and upgrade your account to &ldquo;Adopter&rdquo;. This costs nothing, but you need agree to keep all documents confidential and not further distribute the documentation.</p>\n\n<p>The ANT+ communication part is implemented as a C++ server application, <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/TrainerControl\">TrainerControl</a>, the server accepts TCP connections and sends telemetry data (heart rate, power, speed and cadence) and receives commands over that connection. It uses <a href=\"http://libusb.info/\">libusb</a> for the USB communication, since I wanted my code to be portable. The application currently builds on Windows, but ultimately, I would like to port it to a Raspberry PI running Linux.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why not use Racket for the ANT+ communication?</em> I could have used the Racket Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to provide bindings for libusb, and write the entire ANT+ implementation in Racket. I didn&rsquo;t do it mostly because I took the path of least resistance: I already had experience using libusb from C++ and had no experience with using Racket FFI.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2>\n\n<p>This application is very much in its early stages, only a proof of concept. I&rsquo;d like to expand it to include structured workouts and data recording as well as package it into an application that is ready to use. However, all this will have to wait until next year: summer has arrived here in Australia and I can start riding outdoors again.</p>\n<!-- link definitions-->") (u .

class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The <code>make-current-value-renderer</code> is a function that produces a callback to be attached to a plot snip. The callback is invoked with four parameters: the <code>snip</code> that calls the callback, the mouse <code>event</code>, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates for the mouse event. The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are in plot coordinates, meaning they map to the domain of the data displayed in the plot. The callback creates a <code class=\"brush: racket\">vrule</code> and a <code class=\"brush: racket\">point-label</code> renderer and adds these to the plot using the <code class=\"brush: racket\">set-overlay-renderers</code>. Each time <code class=\"brush: racket\">set-overlay-renderers</code> is called, any previous overlay renderers are discarded.</p>\n\n<p>You can also pass <code>#f</code> to <code class=\"brush: racket\">set-overlay-renderers</code> and this will remove the overlays. This feature is used in the example above: when the form <code>(and\nx y (eq?  (send event get-event-type) 'motion) ...)</code> evaluates to <code>#f</code>, clearing the overlays. Thus, overlays are added only when the mouse is over the actual plot area, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not <code>#f</code> and when the mouse event is a motion event.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"display-the-current-value-of-a-function-the-fancy-version\">Display the current value of a function, the fancy version</h2>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"brush: racket\">point-label</code> renderer used in the previous example has a limited amount of customization for the displayed text: first, the label can only be a text string, second, only the font, size and color of the text can be adjusted, but not the background. For more complex cases, there is the <code class=\"brush: racket\">point-pict</code> renderer, which allows displaying and arbitrary <code>pict</code> instead of the label. The built in Racket <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/index.html\">pict library</a> allows creating sophisticated pictures, including the <code class=\"brush: racket\">dc</code> pict constructor, which allows drawing arbitrary graphics on a device context.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a012/current-value-fancy.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>In the example above, the &ldquo;label&rdquo; displayed is constructed using a pict so that the angle is displayed as a pie slice.

be used to check for mouse button presses and releases, which in turn can be used to implement some GUI operations. In this example, a simple drag select is implemented: the <code>left-down</code> mouse event marks the start of a selection, and the <code>x</code> position is saved into <code>drag-start</code>. While the left button is held down, any motion events will display a <code class=\"brush: racket\">rectangles</code> renderer with the selected area, making the selected area appear shaded.

not directly represent the histogram slots. To convert an X plot coordinate back into the histogram slot, the following information is used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>The X domain is the real axis, starting at 0 by default</li>\n <li>The distance between each histogram bar is specified by the  discrete-histogram-skip parameter or the #:skip argument to the  discrete-histogram renderer</li>\n <li>The width of each histogram bar is one minus discrete-histogram-gap, or the  #:gap parameter passed to the renderer.</li>\n <li>Multiple histograms can be shown, each having a different starting point, as  specified by the #:x-min parameter</li></ul>\n\n<p>The function <code>xposition-&gt;histogram-slot</code> converts an X position back to the histogram series and the slot within that series:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush:

plots in GUI applications</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>snip</code> object produced by <code class=\"brush: racket\">plot-snip</code> will be displayed correctly by DrRacket in the REPL window, however some more work is needed to embed plots in GUI applications. The <code>mrlib/snip-canvas</code> library provides a <code>snip-canvas%</code> object that can hold a <code>snip</code>. The <code>snip-canvas%</code> is a GUI object and can be added to a <code class=\"brush: racket\">frame%</code> or <code class=\"brush: racket\">panel%</code>. The example below extends the first example to show the plot in a separate window. The snip creation code is wrapped inside the <code>make-plot-snip</code> function and this function is passed to the <code class=\"brush: racket\">snip-canvas%</code> constructor to add the snip to the canvas. When the code below is run, the plot should show up in a separate frame, similar to what <code class=\"brush: racket\">plot-frame</code> does. The canvas itself can of course be created as part of a more sophisticated GUI.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n

Technically, there will only be at most one other  selected snip, but the code is written such that it can un-select any number  of snips.</li>\n <li>Each time we remove a snip, the <code>after-select</code> method will be called for  that snip with the <code>on?</code> parameter set to <code>#f</code>, the code needs to be  prepared to handle these calls. Our code could be affected by this since it  sets the <code>opponent-move-locations</code> and <code>valid-move-locations</code> to the empty  list when a snip is unselected &mdash; however since we set the move locations  last for our snip, they will always be set for the selected snip.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"moving-the-snip-in-front-when-dragging-it\">Moving the snip in front when dragging it</h2>\n\n<p>The snips are stored in the <code>pasteboard%</code> in a list, in the same order as they are added and they are also drawn on the canvas in this order. This drawing order is kept even when a snip is dragged with the mouse and this means that the snip will appear to drag under chess pieces which were added to the <code>pasteboard%</code> before this snip. To drag it above all other pieces, we need to move it to the front of the snip list.</p>\n\n<p>We need to update <code>after-select</code> (again) to call <code>set-before</code> and place the selected chess piece in the front of the list. Our application does not rely on the order in which snips are stored in the <code>pasteboard%</code> so we don&rsquo;t need to do place the snip back in its place after it was moved.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">;; rest of the chess-board% definition remains unchanged...</span>\n\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/augment))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/augment</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">after-select</span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"n\">on?</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/when_unless.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._when))\" style=\"color: inherit\">when</a></span> <span class=\"n\">on?</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._this))\" style=\"color: inherit\">this</a></span> <span class=\"n\">set-before</span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">;; Rest of the after-select definition remains unchanged...</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"disable-pasteboard-edits-with-the-keyboard-and-clipboard\">Disable <code>pasteboard%</code> edits with the keyboard and clipboard</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>pasteboard%</code> is configured as an editor and, as such, it is integrated with the keyboard and the clipboard. For example, you can select a snip than move it with the arrow keys or delete it by pressing Del or Backspace. If the application would have an edit menu, you could also Cut, Copy and Paste these snips. All this is undesired behavior in a chess game and we need to disable it.</p>\n\n<p>To disable the Cut/Copy/Paste operations, we need to override the <code>can-do-edit-operation?</code> method to always return <code>#f</code>. This method is invoked to check if the pasteboard is ready to accept a CUT, COPY, PASTE or some other edit operation where the operation name is passed in as an argument. Since we won&rsquo;t support any, we will simply return <code>#f</code> in this method.</p>\n\n<p>To disable the keyboard, we need to define a new <code>keymap%</code> instance mapping the unwanted keys to an &ldquo;ignore&rdquo; function. This keymap is than installed in the <code>pasteboard%</code> before the internal keymap so it effectively overrides these keys. Note that we could have implemented the &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;down&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; keys to move the piece square by square, by this is left as an exercise to the reader, instead we map them to the &ldquo;ignore&rdquo; function which is defined as a function that displays a message informing the user that the key is disabled &mdash; in a real program, this function would simply do nothing, but displaying a message is more useful in a demo program.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td

overriding the <code>on-char</code> method &mdash; the <code>on-default-char</code> method is not useful for this purpose, as it is invoked only if the key press is not processed by a keymap. However, the <code>on-char</code> method performs some other functions and overriding it correctly is tricky and it is easy to get it wrong and break <code>pasteboard%</code> functionality. It is simpler and safer to use keymaps for this feature.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changing-the-way-selected-chess-pieces-are-highlighted\">Changing the way selected chess pieces are highlighted</h2>\n\n<p>By default, the <code>pasteboard%</code> object will draw eight small squares around selected snips (you can see this selection in all the examples in this and previous blog posts), however, we can change the way selection looks.</p>\n\n<p>The drawing of the squares around selected snips can be disabled using the <code>set-selection-visible</code> method, but this will not prevent selecting snips &mdash; snips are still selected, however there is no visual cue to this. We can however change the <code>chess-piece%</code> class to know that it is selected and draw itself in a different way &mdash; to keep this simple, the code is updated to draw selected pieces in red. A new flag <code>selected?</code> is added to this class and it can be set using the <code>set-selected</code> method, than, the <code>draw</code> method is updated to change the text foreground color to red if the chess piece is selected.

"\n<p>I needed a way to measure fatigue as it accumulates during a running session. There is no actual &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; measurement that I&rsquo;m aware of, so I had to find a substitute.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>Intuitively, the longer one runs, the more tired he will become, but using time as a proxy for fatigue does not take into account that one hour of easy running does not produce the same fatigue as one hour of hard interval training. Instead, I decided to use the number of heart beats from the start of the session as a proxy for fatigue: the more heart beats are accumulated, the more tired you are. Since heart rate can never go negative, the heart beats value is always growing. Heart beats also accounts for the intensity of the effort, meaning that more of them are accumulated in the same amount of time during hard interval training versus an easy run.</p>\n\n<p>To show an example, below are two runs of approximately the same duration (1 hour 20 minutes), one easy run and one hard interval run:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a004/hr-comparison.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The heart beats value accumulate at different rates for the two runs, as shown below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a004/hb-comparison.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>To make it easier to work with &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; values, I decided to &ldquo;split&rdquo; the heartbeat values into ranges. I decided to split fatigue levels at 30 minute sections at 160 BPM heart rate. Why 160 BPM? For me, this is the top of &ldquo;Zone 2&rdquo;, that is the top of &ldquo;easy running&rdquo; zone. Why 30 minutes? Again, for me, I can run 30 minutes at an easy pace with no perceived fatigue at all.</p>\n\n<p>The table below summarizes the fatigue values and the heartbeat ranges for each of them. I have also added a &ldquo;Data Points&rdquo; column representing the number of data points at each fatigue value for my 2017 Marathon training season. Most of the data points are in the &ldquo;none&rdquo; fatigue level, and the least of the points are in the &ldquo;severe&rdquo; fatigue level. This is expected, since it takes more than 2 hours of easy running to get to severe fatigue, and most of my runs were less than that.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">Fatigue Level</td>\n    <td>Description</td>\n    <td>Time @160 BPM</td>\n    <td>Heart Beats</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Data Points</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td>\n    <td>none</td>\n    <td>0 &ndash; 30 minutes</td>\n    <td>0 &ndash; 4800</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">179182</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td>\n    <td>mild</td>\n    <td>30 &ndash; 60 minutes</td>\n    <td>4801 &ndash; 9600</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">139689</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">3</td>\n    <td>moderate</td>\n    <td>60 &ndash; 90 minutes</td>\n    <td>9601 &ndash; 14400</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">72519</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td>\n    <td>heavy</td>\n    <td>90 &ndash; 120 minutes</td>\n    <td>14401 &ndash; 19200</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">31306</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align: center\">5</td>\n    <td>severe</td>\n    <td>above 120 minutes</td>\n    <td>above 19200</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">15384</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"technicalities\">Technicalities</h2>\n\n<p>The function shown below will add the heart beats series to a session, which in <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">ActivityLog2</a> is represented as a <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/master/doc/data-frame.md\">data-frame%</a> object.

To address that, we need to override the <code>after-interactive-move</code> method of the <code>pasteboard%</code>, which called every time the user completes a snip drag operation. The method receives a <code>mouse-event%</code> object for the last event of the drag operation and this event object contains the mouse coordinates for where the chess piece was moved to. We can use these coordinates to determine the square location for the destination: this is done in the <code>xy-&gt;location</code> function, as with other functions, this function queries the size of the board, so that the location is always determined correctly:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div

also has an <code>after-move-to</code> method, which can also be overridden. However, this method is invoked every time a snip is moved, including as a result of a call to the <code>move</code> method. If snips are moved inside an <code>after-move-to</code> method they will trigger another call to the <code>after-move-to</code> method, and this needs to be handled carefully otherwise <code>after-move-to</code> will be called recursively in an infinite sequence of calls. It is best to only override this method to implement functionality that does not require further moving of snips.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>You can find the updated program in this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/95530cb80d9ab81102428f5b506e2dee\">GitHub Gist</a> and the result of running it is shown below. Note how the chess pieces snap to the closest square when they are moved with the mouse and any piece at the destination square is removed from the board. So far, however, the program allows any move to be made, and we will fix that, but in the next section we&rsquo;ll look at how to provide better visual feedback when moving pieces.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a018/chess-board4low.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"highlight-the-target-square-during-a-drag-operation\">Highlight the target square during a drag operation</h2>\n\n<p>Since this tutorial is about <code>pasteboard%</code> and graphics, it might be interesting to update the previous program to highlight the destination square as a chess piece is dragged across the board with the mouse, as this will allow us to explore some more <code>pasteboard%</code> methods.</p>\n\n<p>We will need a function which can highlight a square, the function would simply draw another square at a specified location on the board with a <code>brush%</code>, which is used for the background of the square, and a <code>pen%</code>, which draws the outline. In anticipation of further use, this method is more complex than we strictly need now, as it allows specifying the brush and pen colors separately, and if any of these are <code>#f</code>, the relevant part is not drawn, therefore, to just draw the outline, you can specify #f for the <code>color-name</code> and a valid pen color:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table

receives the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> coordinates where the snip would be moved to &mdash; these coordinates represent the top left corner of the snip. This method is invoked even if a snip is moved as a result of a call to <code>move</code>, but the <code>dragging?</code> flag indicates if this is a move resulting from dragging with the mouse or not. In this method, we can determine the location where the chess piece would be placed by applying the <code>drag-dx</code> and <code>drag-dy</code> offsets to the snip position and set <code>highlight-location</code> to this location. Since the background needs a redraw, we also queue a refresh call with the canvas. Note that the method implementation is careful not to call refresh if the target location has not actually changed &mdash; this avoids too many redraws during a drag operation:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">;;

We can implement this easily by adding a <code>valid-moves</code> method to the <code>chess-piece%</code> class, which will return a list of valid moves for the piece, than we can update the <code>after-interactive-move</code> to check the validity of the destination location against this list. First let&rsquo;s update the <code>after-interactive-move</code> method: note that the piece location is updated and any piece at the target location is only removed if the move is valid, also, if the piece location is not updated, <code>position-piece</code> will simply move the piece back to its original location.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n  \n    <span class=\"c1\">;;

Since each piece type (king, queen, knight, etc) has a different set of moves, we could sub-class <code>chess-piece%</code> to provide the different behavior. However, it is actually simpler to provide stand-alone functions for each chess piece type and supply this function to the <code>chess-piece%</code> constructor, so we extend the constructor with a <code>moves</code> argument, which is a function taking the board and the current location, and returning the list of moves. We also need to add a <code>color</code> method to the <code>chess-piece%</code> object: to determine the color we simply look at the piece name: if it is upper case, it is a white piece, otherwise it is black. The overall changes to the class are quite small:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-piece%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip%</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">;;

functions, which implement the actual game logic. There are six move functions, one for each type of chess piece on the board: <code>king-moves</code>, <code>queen-moves</code>, <code>rook-moves</code>, <code>bishop-moves</code>, <code>knight-moves</code> and <code>pawn-moves</code>. These functions are implemented in about 100 lines of Racket code, but only the <code>pawn-moves</code> is listed below, you can find all of them in the full listing in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/c7f3782d189482bcd73aabf272dff09c\">this GitHub gist</a>. The code looks complex, but it only checks various locations on the board for the valid moves to see of they are occupied by friendly or enemy pieces:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table

that are controlled by the opponent as well as the valid moves for the selected piece. Just as with highlighting the current location, the actual drawing of the controlled squares is done in the <code>on-paint</code> method, and since this method has no access to the game logic itself, it relies on two lists of locations <code>valid-move-locations</code> for the location where the selected piece can move and <code>opponent-move-locations</code> where the opponent pieces can move to. The <code>after-select</code> method is called when a piece is selected or unselected and we can override this method to calculate the valid moves lists. The <code>after-interactive-move</code> also needs to keep track of the <code>valid-move-locations</code>, since the location of the selected piece changes after a move:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush:

We will also update the <code>pasteboard%</code> to display a message if the user tries to move a piece of the wrong color.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll start by adding support to display a message on top of the game play board. The message is not interactive, so it will be drawn from the <code>on-paint</code> function, however, since the message needs to be drawn on top of the chess pieces, it will be drawn on the second invocation of <code>on-paint</code>, when the <code>before?</code> argument is <code>#f</code>. The message is stored in the <code>message</code> field and is updated by the <code>set-message</code> method, this method also sets up a timer to clear the message after a predefined interval (2 seconds in our case) and also requests a canvas refresh, as without that, the <code>pasteboard%</code> does not know that it needs a redraw:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table

<code>'white'</code> or <code>'black</code>. The <code>can-interactive-move?</code> method is invoked by the <code>pasteboard%</code> to check if a snip can be moved with the mouse. We can override this method to return <code>#t</code> if the selected piece color is the same as the value of <code>turn</code>, and <code>#f</code> otherwise. This method also calls <code>set-message</code> to display a message if the user tries to move a piece of the wrong color. The <code>after-interactive-move</code> also needs to be updated to alternate the colors for <code>turn</code> after a successful move. As a help for the user, the <code>after-select</code> method is also updated to display a message if the user selects a piece of the wrong color, however the selection is still allowed, so the valid moves squares are still highlighted &mdash; even though the wrong color piece can be selected, it will not move as <code>can-interactive-move?</code> will prevent that:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">chess-board%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"n\">pasteboard%</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">;;

I use this feature mostly to track service reminders: when to replace running shoes or the chain on my bikes, but once in a while I export the usage data as a CSV file, load it up in Google Sheets and calculate <em>cost/use</em> values for the equipment I use. The <strong>cost/use</strong> metric is simply the cost of the equipment divided by the number of uses. I think this is a more relevant metric than simply the cost, since a piece of equipment that I use a lot is more worth while than a cheaper one that I don&rsquo;t use much.</p>\n\n<p>Using the cost/use metric, my <strong>Garmin FR920</strong> is the least expensive piece of equipment I own: I purchased one in November 2014 for $600 and I used it 772 times on running, swimming, biking and hiking sessions. The cost for each session comes out to be just $0.78. I plan to use my FR920 for at least another 6 months and, in that time, the cost/use will come down but at the same time, I will get another pair of running shoes and spend a lot more on swimming. The table below summarizes the cost/use for the FR920 versus running shoes or swimming sessions :</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Equipment</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">Cost / Session</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Garmin FR920</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">$0.78</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Running Shoes</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">$2.66</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Swimming Session</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align: right\">$5.00</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>I buy a new pair of <strong>running shoes</strong> after I use the old pair for about 750 - 800 km . Some time ago, I noticed that my knees started hurting once I ran more than 800 km on a pair of shoes, so now I try to replace them at 750 km. Looking at 11 pair of shoes I went through in the past 7 years, I pay on average $173 for a pair and use it about 65 times: the average cost for a running session is about $2.66.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>bikes</strong> are probably the most expensive item even using the <em>cost/use</em> metric: my mid-range road bike (the <em>Azuri Imperia</em>), which I had for 7 years, still cost me $5.99. My TT bike (a <em>Specialized Shiv</em>) still cost $63.49, although I only had it for less than 2 years and used it only 63 times. Also, bikes are the only piece of equipment that I service regularly, so there is an additional cost of owning them, this cost is not included in these calculations. <strong>Power meters</strong> are another piece of equipment with a high <em>cost/use</em>, although less so than the bikes, probably because they cost less.</p>\n\n<p>The full usage and costs are listed below. <em>Azuri Imperia</em> and <em>Specialized Shiv</em> are my bikes (road and TT respectively), the <em>Vector</em> and <em>Vector 2</em> are power meters, one for each bike. The <em>Brooks</em> set of &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; are all running shoes. <em>Tacx Vortex</em> is a bike trainer. The rest of the equipment names should be self explanatory. The &ldquo;Retired?&rdquo; column shows equipment which I no longer use, for these the cost / use and cost / hour will remain fixed. For each equipment that is not retired, the cost / use and cost / hour will come down as the use count and hours used increase while the cost stays the same.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n

writing (or reading) code it should not be too difficult to determine that the code above defines the following workout:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>A warmup step, 2 miles long with a &ldquo;hr/warmup&rdquo; heart rate (this is defined  above as being a Heart Rate between 60 and 163 BPM</li>\n <li>A repeat (four times) of: 1 mile at tempo pace (this is defined above as  4:45 to 4:31 min/km followed by 1 minute recovery</li>\n <li>5 minutes at an easy pace (defined above as 7:32 to 5:07 min/km)</li>\n <li>another repeat (three times) of: 1 mile at tempo pace followed by 1 minute  recovery</li>\n <li>5 minutes cooldown at an easy pace</li>\n <li>another cooldown step which lasts until the &ldquo;Lap&rdquo; button is pressed on the  watch</li></ul>\n\n<p>As a side note, the code above defines a <code>wk-daniel-q10</code> function, which, when called, returns a byte string representing the binary FIT workout data. This data can be written to a file and transferred to the device.</p>\n\n<p>This method of writing workouts has the advantage that workouts can be written using text editors, and they are really Racket programs, so one has the full flexibility of a programming language when defining them. The library that is used to write these workouts is about 150 lines of code and I was able to write it in an afternoon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-gui-workout-editor\">A GUI workout editor</h2>\n\n<p>I have used the above method for writing workouts for the past four years to write workouts for my training needs, but it is not for everyone. After a while I realized that it has some limitations: even as a programmer, when it comes to managing my training, I prefer a GUI approach, with immediate feedback. In particular, I wanted feedback on the estimated duration of the workout, as well as percentage of time spent in &ldquo;active&rdquo; vs \" recovery\". Writing a GUI application is more difficult than a simple library so I kept postponing this project (for comparison, the GUI workout editor is about 3000 lines of code vs about just 150 for the helper library). However, I had some more spare time than usual in the last few weeks, so I decided to try to implement it. The result is here:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a014/workout-editor.png\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>The workout editor is not released yet (there are still some bugs that need fixing), so you will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">source code</a> and build it.</p>\n\n<p>What it can do now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>build bike and running workouts based on Heart Rate, Pace or Power</li>\n <li>estimate the duration of a workout, useful if you want your workout to fit  in a specified time (e.g. 1 hour), as well as percentage of time spent in  warmup/cooldown or active/rest.</li>\n <li>generate FIT workout files which can be used on a Garmin device (other  devices might work too.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Plans for the future:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Since workouts are stored in the database, activities can be linked back to  workouts. This would be useful in providing better estimates for workout  duration/distance/effort.</li>\n <li>Generate ERG/MRG workout files for use on a <a href=\"/2017/11/bike-trainer.html\">bike  trainer</a></li>\n <li>In addition to time estimates, provide plots of estimated W&rsquo;Bal expenditure  and recovery &mdash; a Critical Power model can determine if the designed workout  is too hard or too easy, which would be really cool.</li></ul>") (u .

The overall functionality and capabilities remain the same but the API is different.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"a-simple-example\">A simple example</h2>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example that replaces the default zoom behavior of the plots with code that displays the current value of the function at the mouse location:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a010/plot-hover-5.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The above plot was generated by running inside DrRacket the source code shown below. The program depends on a special build of the plot library which you can find <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/plot/tree/ah/interactive-overlays\">here</a>, note that the code is on the &ldquo;ah/interactive-overlays&rdquo; branch. You will need to install this as a local package. If you don&rsquo;t know how to do that, <a href=\"/2018/01/changing-built-in-racket-packages.html\">this post</a> may help.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The program works by first creating a plot object using the <code>plot-snip</code> function. Next, the callback <code>on-hover</code> is added to the resulting plot snip object using <code>set-mouse-callback</code>. This callback is invoked each time the mouse moves over the plot and the X and Y coordinates passed to the callback are in the plot domain, in the example above, X will be between &ndash;10 and 10, as this was specified to the plot function, and Y will be between &ndash;1 and 1 which is the range of the sine function. The callback itself can add any number of overlays to the plot and they will be shown. In this example, it adds a vertical line, a marker at the function value at the mouse location and a label where the mouse cursor is.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">#lang </span><span class=\"nn\">racket</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._require))\" style=\"color: inherit\">require</a></span> <span class=\"n\">plot</span> <span class=\"n\">pict</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">add-pict-overlay</span> <span class=\"n\">plot-snip</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"n\">pict</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"n\">plot-snip</span> <span class=\"n\">add-general-overlay</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/lambda.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._lambda))\" style=\"color: inherit\">lambda</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dc</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">draw-pict</span> <span class=\"n\">pict</span> <span class=\"n\">dc</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">pict-width</span> <span class=\"n\">pict</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">pict-height</span> <span class=\"n\">pict</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">on-hover</span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"n\">event</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"n\">snip</span> <span class=\"n\">clear-overlays</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/when_unless.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._when))\" style=\"color: inherit\">when</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._and))\" style=\"color: inherit\">and</a></span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">sx</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._sin))\" style=\"color: inherit\">sin</a></span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">;;

This example is a bit more complex, as there are two linked plots and when the mouse hovers over one of them, the current value at that position is shown on both of them &mdash; this mechanism can be extended to any number of plots.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a010/plot-hover-1.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>This example is from the <a href=\"/2017/09/introducing-activitylog2.html\">ActivityLog2</a> application.

In the image below, the current lap of an activity is highlighted when the user selects a lap on the left. This functionality could also be achieved using the <code>lines-interval</code> plot renderer, but this requires redrawing the entire render tree each time a new lap is highlighted. Since a usual bike ride contains between 5000 and 10000 data points rendering it takes some time and the lap highlight would introduce unpleasant delays.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a010/plot-hover-2.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>This is implemented in the <code>highlight-interval</code> method in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/master/rkt/inspect-graphs.rkt#L752\">rkt/inspect-graphs.rkt</a> file.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"display-complex-information\">Display complex information</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes a plot is based on complex underlying information and displaying it is really useful. The data for the power-duration plot shown below is constructed as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>for each bike session, the mean maximal values are determined for a set of  predefined durations&mdash; that is, the best power maintained over 10s, 15s,  1min, etc, over the entire ride.</li>\n <li>for each duration, the best power for that duration is selected from the  list of sessions</li>\n <li>spline interpolation is used to plot these power values as a function of  duration (the purple line on the plot)</li>\n <li>a theoretical power-duration model is fitted over this data</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is a lot of information, which ultimately is represented as two curves on a plot. Using interactive overlays, the underlying data can be explored: the maximal power and modeled maximal power at the current duration, and the two original data points from which the interpolation is done, including the date when the bike sessions occurred.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a010/plot-hover-3.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>This is implemented in the <code>plot-hover-callback</code> in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/blob/master/rkt/trends-bavg.rkt#L575\">rkt/trends-bavg.rkt</a> file.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"displaying-information-on-histogram-plots\">Displaying information on histogram plots</h2>\n\n<p>Histogram plots benefit from displaying additional information about the bar under the cursor. In the example below, the underlying cummulative times that form the basis for the histogram bars are displayed when the mouse is moved over the relevant section.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a010/plot-hover-4.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p>Histogram plots pose a special challenge as the plot X domain does not directly represent the histogram slots. To convert an X plot coordinate back into the histogram slot, the following information is used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>The X domain is the real axis, starting at 0 by default</li>\n <li>The distance between each histogram bar is specified by the  <code>discrete-histogram-skip</code> parameter or the <code>#:skip</code> argument to the  <code>discrete-histogram</code> renderer</li>\n <li>The width of each histogram bar is one minus <code>discrete-histogram-gap</code>, or  the <code>#:gap</code> parameter passed to the renderer.</li>\n <li>Multiple histograms can be shown, each having a different starting point, as  specified by the <code>#:x-min</code> parameter</li></ul>\n\n<p>The function below converts an X position back to the histogram series and the slot within that

passed, disable the callback. When a hover callback is active, the default &ldquo;zoom on mouse drag&rdquo; behavior of the plot snip is disabled.</p>\n\n<p>The callback is invoked with the snip, the mouse event and the X, Y coordinates where the mouse is. The X, Y coordinates are in plot coordinate system, the domain over which data is being plotted.</p>\n\n<p>The CALLBACK will also be invoked with X and Y being #f when the mouse is over the plot snip, but outside the actual plot area.</p>\n\n<p>The snip% object passed to the callback will always be the one that generated the event and it should be used to add any overlays. Plot snips can be copied (they certainly are when they are shown in DrRacket), and it is easy to receive hover events from a copy and adding overlays to the original.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>clear-overlays</code> will clear all overlays added to the snip. The overlays are only cleared when this method is called, so a callback that adds overlays as the mouse moves should start by clearing the previous overlays.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>refresh-overlays</code> will refresh the plot area and draw the overlays. Overlays are not drawn when they are added, so a callback that adds overlays should finish by refreshing the overlays. Originally, each of the <code>add-*-overlay</code> function contained an internal refresh, but this resulted in the plot being refreshed too many times: once after each overlay was added.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-mark-overlay</code> will add a marker overlay at position X Y on the plot (X and Y are in plot coordinates). The marker is a circle of RADIUS drawn with PEN and BRUSH, or if these parameters are #f a default pen and brush is used. If RADIUS is 0 or negative, the circle is not drawn, this can be used to draw the LABEL only.</p>\n\n<p>LABEL, if not #f, is a string drawn next to the marker, it will be offset in X and Y axes by OFFSET pixels and will be drawn in one of the &ldquo;top-right&rdquo;, &ldquo;top-left&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom-right&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom-left&rdquo; positions such that the label is always inside the plot. For example, the label is drawn top-right of the marker by default, but if this would result in the label being drawn off screen on the right, it will be moved to &ldquo;top-left&rdquo; position.</p>\n\n<p>FONT, FG-COLOR and BG-COLOR are the font, foreground, and background colors for the label. If they are #f, default values are used.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-vrule-overlay</code> adds a vertical line at position X (in plot coordinates) using PEN.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-hrule-overlay</code> adds a horizontal line at position Y (in plot coordinates) using PEN.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-xrule-overlay</code> adds both a vertical and horizontal lines to the plot such that they intersect at X, Y (in plot coordinates). The lines are drawn using PEN. This method is equivalent to adding a vertical line at X and a horizontal line at Y, but it is more efficient.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-vrange-overlay</code> adds a rectangle overlay between XMIN and XMAX, in plot cordinates, for the entire height of the plot.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-hrange-overlay</code> adds a rectangle overlay between YMIN and YMAX, in plot cordinates, for the entire width of the plot.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-rect-overlay</code> adds a rectangle overlay between the points XMIN, YMIN, XMAX, YMAX, in plot coordinates.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>add-general-overlay</code> will add an overlay that is drawn by a user specified function, DRAWN-FN, at X Y (in plot coordinates) adjusted by OFFSET (in pixels) to either &ldquo;top-right&rdquo;, &ldquo;top-left&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom-right&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom-left&rdquo;, such that the drawing area is visible on the plot. WIDTH and HEIGHT represent the dimensions of the picture that will be drawn by DRAWN-FN and they are used to determine the adjustment position relative to the X, Y coordinates.</p>\n\n<p>The function will be invoked with a draw context and X, Y coordinates (in DC coordinates).</p>\n\n<p>This method can be used to draw a pict at a specified position, by using a wrapper such as shown below.

I wrote another <a href=\"../2017/marathon-training-2017-statistics.html\">blog post</a> about some statistics from this data, but this post focuses on fatigue and how it affects Cadence, Stride, Ground Contact Time and Vertical Oscillation.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a separate post about how I decided to <a href=\"../2017/quantifying-fatigue.html\">quantify fatigue</a> accumulated during a run workout. The plots in this post use that method to group data points into five fatigue levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cadence--stride-vs-fatigue\">Cadence + Stride vs Fatigue</h2>\n\n<p>Running pace (how fast you run), is composed of two elements: <strong>cadence</strong> &mdash; how many steps one takes each minute and <strong>stride</strong> &mdash; how long is each step. The plot below plots the cadence vs. stride for each data point, the points being colored by fatigue. Each point also represents a running pace value, The lines on the plot represent the &ldquo;constant pace&rdquo; lines: pace is &ldquo;stride&rdquo; (the length of each step) multiplied by &ldquo;cadence&rdquo; (how many steps each minute). For example, to maintain a 4:00 min/km pace at a cadence of 90 steps/minute, the stride would have to be 1.38 meters. To maintain the same pace at a cadence of 80 steps/minute, the stride would have to increase to 1.56 meters.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a005/cad+stride-fatigue.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<p><em>A note on cadence values:</em> Originally, running cadence was measured by counting number of steps taken with one leg, either left or right. A few years ago, Garmin switched to measuring cadence by counting steps from both legs. I prefer the old style, where a cadence of 90 means &ldquo;90 steps taken with the right (or left) leg only&rdquo;. If you prefer the newer style, just multiply everything by 2. For example, an &ldquo;old style&rdquo; 90 SPM becomes 180 SPM when counting each leg.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"density-plots-for-each-running-form-metric\">Density plots for each running form metric</h2>\n\n<p>The plots below show how the density profile (a histogram, really) for each of the running metrics. Ground Contact Time, or GCT, is the time the foot is in contact with the ground at each step. Vertical Oscillation, or VOSC, is the amount of up-down bouncing the body makes while running. It is measured in millimeters.</p>\n\n<p>The cadence, GCT and VOSC density profiles do not seem change much during the course of a run. There are some humps in the plot mainly because I did intervals at hard and severe fatigue levels and I maintain a higher cadence during these.</p>\n\n<p>Stride (the length of each step) is the only measurement that shows a clear shift towards lower values as fatigue increases.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a005/cad-density.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Fatigue Level</td>\n    <td>Mean Cadence (SPM)</td>\n    <td>StdDev</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>none</td>\n    <td>83.60</td>\n    <td>2.96</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>mild</td>\n    <td>83.33</td>\n    <td>3.90</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>moderate</td>\n    <td>82.96</td>\n    <td>3.31</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>heavy</td>\n    <td>82.65</td>\n    <td>2.96</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>severe</td>\n    <td>83.13</td>\n    <td>2.72</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a005/stride-density.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Fatigue Level</td>\n    <td>Mean Stride (meters)</td>\n    <td>StdDev</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>none</td>\n    <td>1.10</td>\n    <td>0.0714</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>mild</td>\n    <td>1.12</td>\n    <td>0.0808</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>moderate</td>\n    <td>1.11</td>\n    <td>0.0783</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>heavy</td>\n    <td>1.09</td>\n    <td>0.0759</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>severe</td>\n    <td>1.07</td>\n    <td>0.0767</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a005/gct-density.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Fatigue Level</td>\n    <td>Mean GCT (ms)</td>\n    <td>StdDev</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>none</td>\n    <td>284</td>\n    <td>18.42</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>mild</td>\n    <td>285</td>\n    <td>19.08</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>moderate</td>\n    <td>286</td>\n    <td>16.48</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>heavy</td>\n    <td>289</td>\n    <td>15.78</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>severe</td>\n    <td>287</td>\n    <td>15.00</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"figure\"><img src=\"/img/a005/vosc-density.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n <p class=\"caption\"></p></div>\n\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n <table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\">\n  <thead>\n   <tr>\n    <td>Fatigue Level</td>\n    <td>Mean VOSC (mm)</td>\n    <td>StdDev</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>none</td>\n    <td>67</td>\n    <td>5.13</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>mild</td>\n    <td>69</td>\n    <td>5.50</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>moderate</td>\n    <td>69</td>\n    <td>4.82</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>heavy</td>\n    <td>69</td>\n    <td>4.55</td></tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>severe</td>\n    <td>68</td>\n    <td>4.98</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what conclusions to draw from this data, apart from the fact that the plots look pretty.

As of today, my training database contains 2011 training sessions and 2469685 data points, it is 462 Mb in size.</p>\n\n<p>You can find the application on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2\">https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2</a> and you can download a pre-built release from the &ldquo;Releases&rdquo; tab.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img align=\"center\" width=\"800\" alt=\"session view\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0B5h4XOdkim72VmxOOWhYeVN5TGs\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-why-did-i-write-it\">So why did I write it?</h2>\n\n<p>I purchased my first GPS device, a Garmin Forerunner 310XT back in June 2011 and started using the Garmin Connect web site to analyse activities and track my progress. While not perfect, the site was sufficient for my needs and I was happy with it. In 2013 I started training for my first Ironman race, and, about two months before the race, Garmin started upgrading their Garmin Connect web site to a newer version. Unfortunately, this process did not go smoothly and the site was down for extended periods of time. I was sitting in front of my computer, with the Forerunner in my hand and I could not view my latest ride or run because some computer in a data centre half way across the globe was not working properly.</p>\n\n<p>It was around that time that I decided to write my own tool to analyze training data, as I did not want to depend on other people&rsquo;s servers. I wanted an platform that I can fully control, both the training data itself and the software that analyses the data. Here is how ActivityLog2 meets this criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Data is stored on the local computer and you always have access to it as  long as you can access your computer. You are responsible for backing up  your data, of course.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Data is stored in an SQLite database, and can be easily accessed from most  programming languages, without need to go through the ActivityLog2  application. In particular, I have several Excel spreadsheets that connect  directly to it for some of the reports.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The original activity files are stored in the database unmodified, and are  always available if you want to export them to use on some other platform.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The ActivityLog2 application is freely available in source code, and anyone  can see how it works and update it to meet their needs without requiring my  permission</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The ActivityLog2 application already has a decent set of features, but in  addition to this, all data processing algorithms are available as  programming interfaces. This makes it a good starting platform for writing  your own analysis scripts. For example, I have scripts that generate  workouts to download on the Garmin devices, and scripts that perform FTHR  analysis.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>Sometimes after I started working on ActivityLog2, became aware of Golden Cheetah, a program that would have met the criteria, but at that time, GC only supported bike ride activities. This has changed now, but by this time ActivityLog2 has matured enough that I&rsquo;m happy to use it exclusively to track my activities.</p>") (u . "/img/a001/thumb.png"))))
